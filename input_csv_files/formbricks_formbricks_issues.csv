2680214929,4348,Unable to migrate from v2.6 to v2.7,"### Issue Summary

I use self-hosted version. Currently on v.2.6.0. When I run the database migration command (migration to v2.7) it fails with an error and Formbricks v2.7.0 can't launch.

I'm using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image.

When I run migration command for v2.6 (my current version) it's OK, says `Data migration completed`

### Expected Behavior

Migration should be successful

2679646349,4346,[BUG] Inescapable error screen after deleteing a product,"### Issue Summary

When you create more than one product and want delete one of them you will be shown an error which won't let you do anything until log out which can't be done via UI.

### Expected Behavior

The app after deleteing a product or after clicking ""go to dashboard"" button should redirect me to another existing product or any other page that would allow further usage.

### Other information (incl. screenshots, Formbricks version, steps to reproduce,...)

### Steps to reproduce
1. Create new product (for example public website)
2. Do not finish configuration (though I believe it doesn't matter if you do) and go back to dashboard
3. choose newly created product
4. Go to configuration and delete it

Now you're trapped in error screen until signing out.

On a fresh install following the guide at https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/docker and using Traefik, uploaded images are not loaded in the browser.

Inspecting the browser's traffic, I can see that I'm getting a ""400 Bad Request"" error on requests to urls like:

http://subdomain.domain.org/_next/image?url=http://subdomain.domain.org/storage/cm3oen449000810id8pv424zc/public/Digi_DT1--fid--8551fd4d-03f1-400a-be1d-2105741108af.jpg&w=256&q=75

The response content is **""url"" parameter is not allowed**.

I can access the image itself using http://subdomain.domain.org/storage/cm3oen449000810id8pv424zc/public/Digi_DT1--fid--8551fd4d-03f1-400a-be1d-2105741108af.jpg without issues.

### Expected Behavior

I would expect images to be able to load.

I have not tested on another server, but since I'm running with very basic configuration options, I suspect that this can be reproduced on any Formbricks http instance (it may behave differently on https?). I have attached my docker-compose.yml for Formbricks with Traefik labels:

2663566473,4326,Enable custom scopes for OIDC,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I'm trying to integrate Discord as a oauth2 / oidc provider and well, Discord aren't supporting the ""profile"" scope in their authentication. Using the current setup discord will redirect to a page with this :

```json
{""scope"": [""2""]}
```


### Describe the solution you'd like

This leads me to this line where the OIDC scopes are hardcoded.

Removing the ""profile"" from the url called by Formbricks gets me a little further, after accepting the Discord's oauth I get a `AccessDenied`.

While at it, it would be useful not to be dependent on a service with "".well-known/openid-configuration"" link since the provider _might_ not provide or is missing fields.

My use case is the following:

- Call rest API for All Surveys and loop through until I find the one matching the data received from webhook
- Match up answers with questions and create a PDF with these included
- Download their uploaded CV's from the form

Everything up to here works, but now I need to send an email with the data (CV, PDF, etc..) to the person who has created the form. I can see the User ID from when I find the matching Survey - but I do not see a way to get this persons info, so I can send them an email. I am stuck without any where to go at the moment. I might deliver the files some other way, but I would prefer to send them an email.

### Describe the solution you'd like

A Rest API, where I can GET all users and receive all of their account info (ID, name, mail etc..).
It would be even better if I could call the API with the account ID in the request HEADER or BODY and only get info on the specific user.

As a product manager, I want to understand how many unique users have viewed a survey, in addition to seeing the total number of impressions. This will allow us to better evaluate engagement rates and compare different survey delivery methods (e.g., in-app vs. email).

For instance, in a current experiment, we’re testing whether in-app surveys shown multiple times along the user journey yield higher engagement than email surveys. However, without unique impression tracking, it’s difficult to assess how effectively we’re reaching our target audience and whether multiple exposures lead to higher engagement.

### Describe the solution you'd like

A useful enhancement would display:

- Unique Impressions Count: The total number of unique users who have seen the survey, shown alongside the existing metrics for impressions, survey starts, and completions in the reporting view.
- User-Level Detail (Optional): Ideally, the ability to see which user IDs have viewed the survey. However, a minimum viable feature would be a simple count of unique users to provide immediate value.

Managing user inquiries and support requests can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially as user numbers grow. Users often face delays in getting responses, leading to frustration and impacting their experience.



### Describe the solution you'd like

Implement a chatbot within the platform that can automatically handle common user queries, guide users to relevant resources, and offer immediate responses for routine questions. This chatbot could operate on both the main website and integrate into chat platforms like Mattermost or Slack, providing on-demand support and helping users troubleshoot issues or find documentation.

Key features:

FAQ Handling: Respond to frequently asked questions.
Guided Support: Help users navigate specific processes or workflows.
Real-time Notifications: Push updates for relevant issues, PRs, and other important events.
Escalation: Redirect complex queries to live support or create support tickets if the bot is unable to assist.

### Steps to Reproduce

## Scenario:
 - First fork the [formbricks repo](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks) in your own github account.
 - Now visit the forked repo inside your account.
 - click the ""code"" button(at the right side) and visit codespaces to click create codespace for the forked repo.
 - This will start loading the Codespace. Keep in mind this might take a few minutes to complete depending on your internet connection and the instance availability.
 - Once the Codespace is loaded, you will be redirected to the VSCode editor. You can start working on your project in this environment.


### Expected behavior

I have followed all the guideline given in the [Formbricks docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/contributing/codespaces). It should work as mentioned in the guideline. I have tried four times using different workspace. But it is not working.

2625981219,4169,"[BUG] ""Other"" Option in Single-Select Auto-Selects Choices, Blocking Custom Input","### Issue Summary

The form question, ""What's your favorite mode of transport?"" is set up as a single-select with radio buttons, including an ""Other"" option for custom input. When a user selects ""Other"" and begins typing a specific choice, like ""Car,"" the form automatically selects the ""Car"" option from the list, preventing the user from typing additional choices (e.g., ""Car and Train""). This issue makes it difficult to provide multiple custom answers in the ""Other"" field.

Although using a multi-select input could resolve this, if the creator intends to keep radio buttons with an ""Other"" option I think this is an issue in that scenario. Ideally, the ""Other"" field should allow users to type any custom response without automatically selecting predefined options.

This issue was encountered recently in the feedback form—side quest as well.

### Steps to Reproduce

Attached the video

### Expected behavior

It should allow any custom response.

Accessibility Advocate



### Points

50-300

### Description

I've identified two accessibility and usability issues in the Formbricks that could benefit from improvements:

**1. Preview Form Reset:**
When clicking ""Restart"" in the form preview, the input values aren’t clearing as expected. Instead, the fields retain the previous values, which can be confusing for users expecting a fresh start.
 
**2. UI Flashing in Background Animation Settings:**
In the ""Look and Feel"" settings under the ""Background Styling"" section, selecting any animation style in the ""Animation"" tab causes a UI flash and a re-render of all animation options. This visual disruption feels unintended and may negatively impact user experience.

While creating a survey for my website, I found it pretty annoying to drag and drop questions using the touchpad on my Mac. This made me think about using up/down keyboard arrow keys as an alternative way to reorder survey questions.

### Describe the solution you'd like

## Add keyboard shortcuts (up/down arrow keys) to reorder survey questions as an alternative to drag-and-drop.

Expected Behaviour
- Select a question (via click or keyboard focus)
- Press ↑ to move question up
- Press ↓ to move question down
- Press Enter to finalize the question's new position
- Press Escape to reset question to its original position

I want to create an advanced calculator to help users calculating their maximum rent they have to pay. 
For that I need a way for the user to input a number and have this number assignes to a variable for further calculations. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Add a field in conditional logic to allow varaibles to be set by a previous answer the user has given. 

Example: 
The user is asked how much rent he is paying. The users answers. The answer is being calculated and a result appears based on the users number input.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the official docs for the [airtable integration](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/integrations#airtable)
2. Follow the self-hosted steps
3. Copy the client ID and define it as `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
4. Redeploy Formbricks
5. Click on the ""Connect"" button on the Airtable integration (which was greyed-out until we reconfigured the `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` variable)
6. Select base and click on ""Grant access"" on Airtable


### Expected behavior

1. Browser redirects back to Formbricks
2. Formbricks activates the integration

### Other information

The `AIRTABLE_REDIRECT_URL` is not used in the code, thus it's not required.  
As guessed, the redirect URL is automatically built [here](apps/web/app/api/v1/integrations/airtable/callback/route.ts#L47).

The docs should be updated, I'll try to do that in a dedicated PR.

Yes, the current survey platform allows for survey creation and sharing, but lacks the ability to provide immediate, real-time feedback and insights to users. they need to either manually export survey data for analysis / wait until a survey is fully completed before reviewing responses.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Response rates over time.
User sentiment analysis based on answers to qualitative questions.
Key trends in multiple-choice responses.
 Users should also be able to export these insights into various formats (PDF, CSV) for sharing or further analysis.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Google Data Studio, Power BI
this would require additional configuration and complexity for users, while real-time analytics built directly into the platform would provide a more seamless experience.

2601662921,3944,[SECURITY] User Email Enumeration via Forgot Password Page,"### Issue Summary

Rohit reported another security issue:

----

Target URL: https://app.formbricks.com/auth/forgot-password

Vulnerability Type: User Email Enumeration

Severity: Medium

Description
The ""Forgot Password"" functionality on the formbricks website allows attackers to enumerate registered email addresses. When an attacker inputs an email address in the ""Forgot Password"" field, the response differs based on whether the email is registered or not. This discrepancy allows attackers to verify if a given email address is associated with an account on the platform.

Steps to Reproduce
Navigate to the Forgot Password page:

URL: https://app.formbricks.com/auth/forgot-password

Test with a registered email:

Enter the email: matti@formbricks.com (assumed registered user).
Submit the form.

Observe the response for registered email:

Test with a non-registered email:

Enter the email: invalid_email@example.com (assumed non-registered user).
Submit the form.
Observe the response for non-registered email:

The system returns a different message.

Conclusion:

The difference in responses allows an attacker to check if a particular email is registered on the platform.

Impact
An attacker can use this vulnerability to:

Enumerate a list of valid email addresses registered on the site.
Conduct targeted phishing attacks using the verified email list.
Perform brute-force attacks on exposed email addresses if combined with credential stuffing attacks.

Recommended Fix:-

Standardized Response:

Return a generic response such as: ""If the email is registered, you will receive password reset instructions."" regardless of whether the email is valid or not. This prevents attackers from discerning between registered and non-registered emails.
Rate Limiting and CAPTCHA:

Implement CAPTCHA to prevent automated bots from exploiting this vulnerability.
Enforce rate limiting to reduce the likelihood of brute-force attempts.
Monitoring and Logging:

Track and log attempts to abuse the password reset feature for enumeration purposes.

poc:
screen recording are attached in mail

Thank You
Rohit Sharma (r0x5r)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. (for example) Went to ...
2. Clicked on...
3. ...


### Expected behavior

The response the user gets should be the same no matter if the email address is found or not, e.g.
""If an account with this email exists, you will receive password reset instructions shortly.""

2600768863,3936,[BUG] Deleted Account Causes Error Page Without Redirection to Login/Signup,"### Issue Summary

When a user deletes their account in one browser (Browser B), but continues to interact with the application in another browser (Browser A), the application shows an error page stating ""Error loading resources: This resource doesn’t exist or you don’t have the necessary rights to access it."" However, when the user clicks ""Go to Dashboard,"" they are not redirected to the login/signup page or the actual dashboard, leaving them stuck on the error page.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in to the application in Browser A and Browser B.
2. Delete the account in Browser B.
3. Continue to interact with the application in Browser A (e.g., click on links or buttons).
4. Encounter the error page.
5. Click the ""Go to Dashboard"" button.

### Expected behavior

- The user should be redirected to the login/signup page after account deletion.
- If accessing the dashboard, the app should detect the session issue and prompt the user to log in again.
 
# Actual Behavior:
- The user remains stuck on the error page without being redirected to login/signup or the dashboard.

### Other information

# Suggested Fix:

- Upon detecting a deleted account, redirect the user to the login/signup page automatically.
- Ensure the ""Go to Dashboard"" button checks if the user is still authenticated and redirects them to the appropriate page if not logged in.

Fix the styling of the open text summary card, it seems off maybe when a response has a very large text in it

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a survey with an open-text question in it
2. Fill it a few times with various length values
3. see the user name wraps in multiple lines


### Expected behavior

- table should look good, text shouldn't wrap(at least up to a certain width) 
- please don't use `white-space: nowrap` directly, either wrap the text if it reaches some width that you can test with different user names, or else add ellipsis.

1. Find out what this card like preview is (the first image)
2. Look at how we built the second preview
3. Combine that knowledge and do the following:

- If a survey has a logo set, take that logo and place it on a light grey background (#f1f5f9)
- If it does not have a logo set, take the brandColor and add the Formbricks logo (attached)

2593138011,3835,[BUG] Back button label text gets overridden,"### Issue Summary

I am using Formbricks cloud. 

**Problem:**
When creating or editing cards in a Formbricks Cloud form, the back button label text for all cards is consistently overwritten with the text used on the last card saved. This occurs despite assigning unique back button text to each step of the form.

**Specific Behavior**:

Next Button: The next button label text remains as intended for each card.
Back Button: The back button label text for all cards is replaced with the text used on the most recently saved card.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. create different cards
2. edit the second card ""Next"" Button Label and ""Back"" Button Label with different names ""Pluto"" and ""Mouse"". Save.
3. edit the third card  ""Next"" Button Label and ""Back"" Button Label with NEW different names ""Jerry"" and ""Tom""
when saving, Mouse is overwritten by Tom. Both cards now have the same ""Back"" Button Label but two different ""Next"" Button Labels (Pluto and Jerry).

### Expected behavior

Every ""Back"" Button Label should maintain its own value

2592387384,3831,[BUG] a11y: Address Question Type Not Accessible to Screen Readers,"### Issue Summary

The input fields for the address info question type are missing proper labels, making them inaccessible to screen readers. A placeholder is currently used, but placeholders do not act as labels. Each input field should have an aria-label that is accessible to screen readers. Additionally, I recommend adding visible labels for sighted users, as using placeholders as labels is poor practice. Once a user starts typing, the placeholder disappears, and users might forget what they are supposed to input.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a address info question.
2. Attempt to use a screen reader to interact with the input fields.
3. Notice that the input fields do not have accessible labels, and placeholders disappear when typing, making it unclear what information is required.


### Expected behavior

Each address input field should have an accessible aria-label describing the expected input.
Visible labels should be present above or next to each input field to provide clear instructions for all users, not just those using assistive technology.

2592362848,3830,[BUG] a11y: Date Selection Not Accessible for Screen Readers,"### Issue Summary

The Date Selection component is not accessible to screen readers due to improper use of HTML elements. Currently, a div with tabindex=0 is used in place of a button, and screen readers do not recognize it as an interactive element for selecting a date. Additionally, the text ""Select a date"" is presented as a paragraph, but it should be a label to ensure clarity for screen reader users.

The error message ""Please select a date"" is also inaccessible because it is simply a span inside a div, and screen readers do not announce it properly.

After a date is selected, the component should still be a button, and the screen reader should announce the selected date using an aria-label like ""You have selected 12/12/2024.""

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a date selection question.
2. Attempt to interact with the date picker using a screen reader.

### Expected behavior

The date selection control should use a button element with an appropriate label, such as ""Select a date,"" to make it accessible for screen readers.
Error messages like ""Please select a date"" should be properly associated with the input and announced by screen readers.
After a date is selected, the button should update with an accessible aria-label to announce the selected date, for example, ""You have selected 12/12/2024.""

The File Upload component is inaccessible to screen readers due to improper use of HTML elements. Currently, a div with `tabindex=1` is used in place of a button, and screen readers do not recognize this as an interactive element for file selection. Additionally, the text ""Click or drag to upload files"" is a paragraph, but it should be a label for the upload action.
After a file is uploaded, the file name is displayed in a paragraph, which is not accessible for screen readers. Instead, there should be an aria-label that announces, ""You've successfully uploaded the file XYZ,"" where XYZ is the name of the uploaded file.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a file upload question.
2. Attempt to use a screen reader to interact with the file upload component.
3. Observe that the file upload control is not recognized as a button, and the instruction text is not linked to the action.

### Expected behavior

The file upload control should use a button element with an appropriate label that clearly indicates the file upload action. The ""Click or drag to upload files"" instruction should be associated as a label to make the process clearer for screen reader users.

Users are unable to answer the matrix question using a screen reader because proper labels are missing. Each input option in the matrix should include an `aria-label` that clearly identifies the corresponding question. This will ensure that screen readers can accurately describe the question and the available answer options to users with accessibility needs.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a survey with a matrix question
2. Attempt to navigate and answer using a screen reader.
3. Observe that the input options are not labeled correctly, preventing interaction.

### Expected behavior

Each input option in the matrix question should have an appropriate aria-label that conveys the question being asked.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The navbar should appear and disappear with a smooth transition when scrolling, creating a more visually appealing effect. Adding a transition property to the navbar will make it gradually visible or hidden, rather than suddenly.

The loader color for the ""Save"" and ""Save & Close"" buttons is not consistent after clicking either button. The expectation is that both buttons should display the same loader color, but currently, they are showing different colors during the loading process.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the edit survey page with the ""Save"" and ""Save & Close"" buttons.
2. Click on the ""Save"" button and observe the loader color.
3. Click on the ""Save & Close"" button and observe the loader color.

### Expected behavior

 Both buttons should have the same loader color after clicking. I think it should be same as in overall app light dark or make as with Save & Close button.

2589422070,3783,[BUG] React-Native SDK al,"### Issue Summary

I tried to integrate Formbricks ReactNative SDK into my mobile app using the documentation here https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/react-native-in-app-surveys 
My formbricks installation is self-hosted and can connect via the JS SDK, but when I try the React Native SDK I always see the following errors instead of the survey:

```
 LOG  🧱 Formbricks - 2024-10-15T16:17:20.923Z [DEBUG] - Fetched 1 surveys during sync: New Survey
 LOG  🧱 Formbricks - 2024-10-15T16:17:20.924Z [DEBUG] - Formbricks: Action ""New Session"" tracked

 ERROR  🧱 Formbricks - 2024-10-15T16:17:20.924Z [ERROR] - {}

```

I tried the example code here https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/demo-react-native/src/app.tsx and received the same result. I noticed that if I remove all surveys the error disappears, but I have not found any survey settings/configurations that allow a survey to appear without an error. I found a similar thread on the Discord help channel, but that issue was not resolved.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create sample survey on self-hosted formbricks install
2. Followed integration instructions here (install NPM module, add initialization code, etc) : https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/react-native-in-app-surveys 
3. Ran project and received error

2589119433,3769,[BUG]: Scroll to Top Button Missing on All Pages Except Home Page,"### Issue Summary

## Summary : 
The ""Scroll to Top"" button, which allows users to quickly return to the top of the page, only appears on the Home Page. It is missing from all other pages across the website, leading to inconsistent user experience and navigation difficulties when scrolling through longer content on other pages.

### Steps to Reproduce

- 1.(for example) Went to https://formbricks.com/pricing, https://formbricks.com/open-source-form-builder
- 2.Scroll down the page, and observe that the ""Scroll to Top"" button does not appear.
- 3.Note that the button should be visible, as it is on the Home Page.


### Expected behavior

The ""Scroll to Top"" button should be consistently visible and functional across all pages of the website, not just the Home Page. When a user scrolls down a page, the button should appear, and upon clicking, it should smoothly scroll back to the top of the current page.

### Other information

- Ensure that the button design and functionality are uniform across all pages.
- Check for any CSS or JavaScript conflicts that might be causing the button to be restricted to the Home Page.
- Test the button on different devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.

2588898809,3768,[BUG] a11y: Ranking question is not fully keyboard accessible,"### Issue Summary

The ranking question type is difficult to navigate and interact with using only a keyboard. Users are unable to effectively select and reorder items in the ranking list, making it inaccessible for those who rely on keyboard navigation. Specifically:

- The ranking options are wrapped in <div> elements that can be selected via keyboard, but they are missing proper aria-labels.
- Up/down arrows for reordering do not have descriptive labels and are not targetable via keyboard (they currently have `tabindex=""-1""`).
- Selecting and reordering options is really confusing.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a survey with a ranking question.
2. Attempt to reorder items using only the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys).
3. Notice that the ranking options and reorder controls are difficult to interact with or are completely inaccessible.

### Expected behavior

The ranking question should be fully keyboard-accessible, allowing users to reorder items using intuitive keyboard navigation. This includes:

1. Using semantic HTML elements like <input> or <button> for interactive elements instead of <div>.
2. Providing descriptive labels (e.g., ARIA labels) for the up/down arrows used to reorder items.
3. Ensuring that the up/down arrows are focusable and targetable via keyboard (i.e., removing tabindex=""-1"").

2588824393,3767,a11y: Missing ARIA labels and alt text for image select inputs,"### Issue Summary

Image select questions do not currently allow users to define alternative text for images. This makes it difficult for screen readers to provide visually impaired users with the necessary context. Without an accessible label or alt text, users relying on assistive technologies are unable to identify or understand the content of the images.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a form with an image select question.
2. Attempt to interact with the image options using a screen reader (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA).
3. Notice that the images are not described or labeled, leaving users without context.

### Expected behavior

Each image in the image select question should have an alternative text that describes the image’s content or purpose. This alt text should also be available as an ARIA label for assistive technologies.
`<img src=""image1.png"" alt=""Sunset over mountains"" aria-label=""Select image of a sunset over mountains"">

Screen reader users cannot properly interact with the rating question inputs because they lack descriptive labels. Without these labels, it's difficult for users to understand the layout and functionality of the rating system. For better accessibility, each rating input should have an explicit ARIA label that describes its function.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a survey with a rating question using a screen reader (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA).
2. Try to interact with the rating inputs (e.g., selecting 1 to 5 stars).
3. Observe that the screen reader does not announce any helpful information for each input.

Each rating input should have an ARIA label that describes its purpose. For example:
`<input type=""radio"" name=""rating"" value=""5"" aria-label=""Select this option to give 5 stars"">`

2586735524,3714,[BUG] Header Overlaps Account Settings in Scrollable Views,"### Issue Summary

When scrolling on the ""Account Settings"" page, the header overlaps the ""Account"" section, making it hard to see. The header is the same color as the page, which causes the content to get hidden and hard to differentiate.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the ""Account Settings"" page.
2. Scroll down.
3. Notice that the ""Account"" section gets cut off because of the header.

### Expected behavior

The header should not hide the content, and it should be a different color to stand out from the page.

### Other information

1. Change the header color to something different from the rest of the page.
2. Make sure the header doesn’t overlap the content when scrolling.

2585043317,3681,[BUG] Survey still shown after timeout despite URL mismatch,"### Issue Summary

When triggering a survey with a condition such as ""show on pages that include '/search'"" and adding a delay (e.g., 10 seconds), the survey still pops up after the timeout even if the user navigates to a different page. This behavior occurs only in a single-page application (SPA) environment, where the URL no longer matches the condition.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up a trigger with the condition: ""Show on pages that include '/search'.""
2. Add a delay of 10 seconds to the survey.
3. In a single-page application, navigate to a page that includes '/search'.
4. Before the 10-second delay completes, navigate to another page that doesn't match the trigger condition.

### Expected behavior

The survey should not be shown if the user navigates to a page that doesn't match the trigger condition, even after the delay.

In the Formbricks docs we use `shiki` for code syntax highlighting. We use a very old version `0.14.7` instead of the current version `1.22.0`. Since a lot of the functionality changed between those versions it's not a simple upgrade and all previous attempts failed.

Please upgrade `shiki` to the newest version `1.22.0` and make sure the build still works and also the syntax highlighting in Formbricks Docs still work.

### Other information

You can start the docs server like this:
```
pnpm dev --filter=@formbricks/docs...
```

The docs are then available at http://localhost:3001/docs/

and to build it:

2581773829,3485,[BUG] Clicking on Sub Menu of Question's Editor Triggers Opening and Closing of the Question Editor,"### Issue Summary

When clicking on the sub-menu of the question's editor, the question editor unexpectedly opens and closes immediately. This behavior occurs when trying to interact with the sub-menu, which should not affect the main question editor's visibility.



## Screen Recording:
[Screencast from 11-10-24 09:56:54 PM IST.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e2993a1-8fb2-42c2-b9e3-4ffdfe5595fd)


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the questions editor.
2. Click on the sub-menu (any menu item under the question's editor).
3. Observe that the question editor toggles open and closed with each click, making it difficult to interact with the sub-menu options.

### Expected behavior

Clicking on the sub-menu should allow interaction with the menu options without toggling the question editor itself.


### Other information

## Actual Behavior
The question editor opens and closes with each click on the sub-menu, preventing smooth interaction.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/953140bc-ff43-4210-8c37-ad78f7abd1ed)

I wanted to create a survey and found myself clicking the card twice, which might annoy users who expect things to happen right away.

On this page [Survey Templates](https://app.formbricks.com/environments/cm24aeb7m0006swupqpi5bzft/surveys/templates), the button makes sense. But on this page [Surveys](https://app.formbricks.com/environments/cm24aeb7m0006swupqpi5bzft/surveys) (when we don't have any survey), it feels unnecessary. Removing it would make the process smoother.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I’d prefer to have the button visible inside the card by default instead of having to click to make it appear.

Alternatively, we could remove the button altogether and redirect to the relevant URL when the card is clicked. That would align better with my expectations.

We can use a boolean to determine whether to show the button by default or not. (for 2 pages above)

### Describe the solution you'd like

If I mistakenly refresh the page while I had filters, then it would be a tedious job to add all filters again.
We might wanan share the URL with someone, I could see exact filters as they have.

2580464248,3428,[BUG] Loading Spinner inside a button,"### Issue Summary

When I logged into the app and went to create an organization.
When I clicked submit button, the loader spinner was over the text. 

Here's the URL: https://app.formbricks.com/setup/organization/create

I've attached a video of it as well.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b536152-6b1e-481a-ad45-1d04192c484a



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Login the app first time
2. create organization (https://app.formbricks.com/setup/organization/create)
3. You'll see loader spinner

NOTE: I've also seen similar behaviour when I invite any person to my organization and button has same spinner over the text. I believe it appears on all buttons.


### Expected behavior

We could go with one of the following:
- Spinner should be next to text inside button with a space between it and update the text from ""Continue"" -> ""Saving"" or ""Submitting""
- Completely hide the text so we've spinner in the center.

Note:
I was testing the UI and  ended up creating bunch of surveys It felt annoying to manually delete each of the surveys , Don't know if it is a worth it Issue , but I think If you have options to sort the surveys might as well add bulk delete of surveys for smoother experience.

2579432940,3389,[FEATURE] Enhance border and visibility of Back button,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

The Back button's border in the survey file upload form is not clearly visible, which could lead to confusion for users trying to navigate back. The lack of a distinct border can cause usability concerns, especially for users with visual impairments or when the background is of a similar color.
![Screenshot from 2024-10-10 22-11-16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480195b0-27d2-44ef-ba19-13b201a849f3)


### Describe the solution you'd like

Please enhance the visibility of the Back button by adding a more prominent border (e.g., a darker or thicker border). Alternatively, consider using a contrasting color for the border to improve the overall user experience.

2578878641,3364,[FEATURE]  Add Dark Theme Toggle Option,"### What side quest or challenge are you solving?

formbricks currently only supports a light theme, which can be straining on the eyes, especially in low-light environments. It would improve user experience by allowing users to switch to a dark theme, making it more comfortable for prolonged use and accommodating user preferences for different lighting conditions.

### Points

 500

### Description
I would like to see a dark theme toggle option implemented in formbricks . A button or switch could be added to the user interface that allows users to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly. This could be stored in the user’s settings for persistence across sessions.
As an alternative, I have considered using browser extensions or custom CSS to force a dark theme, but this isn't as user-friendly or integrated into the platform as a built-in toggle option.

This feature would make the tool more accessible to users who prefer dark mode for visual comfort or battery conservation on certain devices.  ",,

2575310356,3344,[BUG] Broken Redirects on `Developer Docs` -> `Contributing` Page,"### Issue Summary

Several broken redirect links were identified on the `Developer Docs` page. These links currently point to incorrect paths, causing users to get 404 error.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Developer Docs -> Overview Page Redirect**:
   On the page `https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/overview`, under the section `Contributing to Formbricks`, the redirect link `/developer-docs/contributing` is broken.

2. **Developer Docs -> Contributing Section Redirects**:
   On the page `https://formbricks.com/docs/developer-docs/contributing/get-started`, under the section `Setup Dev Environments`, the redirects for Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces are broken.

### Expected behavior

1. **Developer Docs -> Overview Page Redirect**:
    `/developer-docs/contributing` should point to `/developer-docs/contributing/get-started`.

2. **Developer Docs -> Contributing Section Redirects**:
   - For Gitpod: The link `/docs/developer-docs/contributing/gitpod` should be updated to `/developer-docs/contributing/gitpod`.
   - For GitHub Codespaces: The link `/docs/developer-docs/contributing/codespaces` should be updated to `/developer-docs/contributing/codespaces`.

### Other information

These URL issues occur because the `basePath` is set to `/docs`, and the current links unnecessarily include `/docs` in the redirect path, leading to broken routes.

### Screenshots

1. For Overview Page:

2573916391,3336,[BUG] JS assets not cachable by Cloudflare & Cloudfront,"### Issue Summary

The js assets provided by Formbricks are not cachable by Cloudflare or Cloudfront since those platforms cannot properly handle the `vary: RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch` header that is set by Nextjs.


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open https://app.formbricks.com/api/packages/js
2. Check `cf-cache-status` header to see that this resource is not cached by Cloudflare
3. Check `x-vercel-cache` header to see that this resource is cached by Vercel
4. Users that do not host Formbricks on Vercel will have issues scaling the application since the uncached js assets will lead to high server load

### Expected behavior

js assets can be easily cached when using Cloudflare / Cloudfront

### Other information

_No response_

### Screenshots

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f93bd91-51cc-4f96-b35a-ffe7314ae6fa)
Cloudflare does not cache the request to https://app.formbricks.com/api/packages/js despite the cache-control header being set. This will lead to a high Vercel bill in the long run (since Cloudflare bandwidth is cheaper).

2572668149,3327,[FEATURE] Do not eval inline the SDK as it may break CSPs,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

We use CSP and do **not** allow `'unsafe-inline'` in our `script-src`. 

The contents of the SDK are fetched and evaluated inline here: <https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/ed7662be5d4493851da5ea2c16aafc331c86c189/packages/js/src/shared/load-formbricks.ts#L22> 

This will violate a CSP unless:
1.  we allow `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`, which is not ideal for security
2. we allow `'sha256-...'` i.e. whitelist the contents of the SDK,  but this changes very frequently and hard to keep up with.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Let the browser fetch the script. This way we can whitelist the domain `https://app.formbricks.com`

2568295164,3302,[BUG] Internal Server Errors still shows success toast,"### Issue Summary

Sometimes internal server errors occur and the next server will respond with a `serverError: ""Something went wrong while executing the operation.""` (but still status code 200). Because of status 200 the frontend will not recognize it as an error and will still show a success toast (although something went wrong).
Formbricks should check the responses for a serverError when accessing backend functions:

```
if (result?.serverError) {
    throw new Error(""Something went wrong"");
}
```


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use eg #3301 to trigger an unsuccessful server only action
2. success toast will pop up although the operation actually failed

This happens in many places where the toast will pop up when there is no error during a server side action.

### Expected behavior

An error toast indicating the issue pops up (instead of falsely suggesting a successful operation)

2557573165,3227,Add Support for Likert-scale Question Type,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I'm frustrated when I'm trying to gather nuanced feedback using Formbricks, but the available question types are either too binary or not structured enough to capture the range of opinions effectively. Without a Likert scale option, it's difficult to ask questions that allow respondents to express varying degrees of agreement or satisfaction. This limits the depth of insights I can gather from users.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like Formbricks to support Likert scale questions, where respondents can rate their level of agreement or opinion on a symmetric scale (e.g., from ""Strongly Disagree"" to ""Strongly Agree""). Ideally, this feature should allow customization of:

- The number of scale points (e.g., 3-point, 5-point, 7-point).
- The labels for each point on the scale (e.g., ""Strongly Disagree"", ""Disagree"", ""Neutral"", etc.).
- Whether a neutral/midpoint option is included.

This would provide a more flexible and powerful way to collect subjective feedback on user experiences, satisfaction, and other important metrics.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

One alternative solution I have considered is using a series of radio buttons or a rating question. However, these options are not as visually clear or consistent as a Likert scale. Using radio buttons also makes it harder for respondents to intuitively understand the order of the options, making the data less reliable compared to a standardized Likert scale format.

### Additional context

Adding Likert scale questions would greatly enhance the capability of Formbricks for surveys and forms that require qualitative feedback. Many popular survey tools, such as Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, already include Likert scale functionality, and adding it would make Formbricks more competitive. 

This feature would be especially helpful for UX research, employee engagement surveys, and customer satisfaction forms, where detailed opinion data is needed.",,

Users should not be easily confronted with the dashboard sign-in page. When they get a survey link, e.g. `formbricks.domain.com/s/1234`, they could just open `formbricks.domain.com` to poke around. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Allow to set two environment variables, one for the public-facing domain (where forms are served) and an admin domain (which is not shared publically). 

This would also enable to show a nice info/welcome page on the root of the public-facing domain instead of the sign-in page.

2535824427,3159,[BUG] 52% Pixel File Size Due to Buffer Polyfill,"### Issue Summary

The `website.umd.cjs` pixel file is larger than necessary at 54KB, with 52% of the file size coming from the Buffer polyfill, which is being imported from `packages/api/client/storage`. Since the pixel does not require file upload functionality right away, this code can be relocated to the surveys package, where it's actually needed.

Proposal:

- Adjust the imports to prevent the inclusion of the Buffer polyfill in the website.umd.cjs pixel file.
- Consider adding `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to the vite config to help visualize the sources contributing to the file size. This plugin generates a visualization without modifying the compiled code, making it easier to identify unnecessary bloat.

Before (54KB):

1. Misleading Usage of the Term ""App"": The current usage of the term ""App"" within Formbricks is unclear and causes significant confusion for users. To improve clarity, I recommend replacing ""App"" with ""Web App"" to better reflect its purpose and avoid misunderstanding.
2. Misleading Usage of the ""People"" Tab: Formbricks has user accounts (members) and customers/website users that are tracked (people). However, the ""People"" tab can be can be confused with the member overview.

2525245979,3145,"[FEATURE] PDF download for Summary View, similar to SurveyMonkey","### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Not related to an issue, but one of the biggest ""mainstream"" survey platforms (SurveyMonkey) has this as a paid feature.

### Describe the solution you'd like

SurveyMonkey has a feature to export a PDF file with bar graphs in addition to the CSV/XLS exports of all the raw data.

There's already a nice view and layout of the statistics in the Summary view of Formbricks, if I was able to export it as a PDF that would be awesome and an easier way to share those statistics without having to create new accounts or publishing the results publicly.

Example of what SurveyMonkey's export looks like for a multipleChoice type:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71d402e-15b7-4b03-ad97-9a10e3c7c0e4)


### Describe alternatives you've considered

It could potentially be as easy as having a ""Print"" button somewhere on the Summary page that opens a minimal UI version in a new tab. Something that removes the side bar and the filter/share buttons. Then, most browsers could simply ""Print to PDF"" and nothing in Formbricks would need to actually generate a PDF. I think the current layout in the Summary page is already perfect for this kind of export.

For now, I'm building a python daemon that collects data from the API and builds a similar PDF using a combination of pandas and pymupdf, then emails it to the execs once a month. I don't think I would be able to port it over to node since my abilities in JS are very limited.

The daemon I built is sort of specific to my use-case, but I could potentially make it public with a few tweaks if anyone is interested. Right now it only supports `multipleChoiceSingle`, `multipleChoiceMulti`, and `matrix` type questions, but I could potentially add more support while I finish it up over the next week. I have it setup to run as an additional container in docker-compose alongside the rest of formbricks' containers.

2522824213,3142,[FEATURE] 'Back to Top' button on Summary screen,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Scrolling through data can be sped up a bit by adding a floating ""Back to Top"" button on the summary page. This way, if I am viewing one of the questions near the end of my survey and decide I need to add a filter, I can very quickly get back to the top of the page without affecting any other filters I might have applied.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Floating 'Back to Top' button on Summary page

### Describe alternatives you've considered

A more complicated alternative could be to add a few floating buttons that not only allow you to scroll back to the top quickly, but also apply filters directly from the location you are on the page.

Although that would be nice, I think at least a scroll to top button is something that could be useful for everyone.

2522815755,3141,[BUG] [Summary] Clicking 'load more' on an 'Other' field applies a filter,"### Issue Summary

When viewing the Summary screen for a survey that has an 'Other' field in multipleChoice questions, there is a 'load more' button that appears if there is a long list of user inputs.

If you click this button, a view filter is applied to the whole summary list.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create survey with at least 1 multipleChoice type question
2. Add an 'Other' field to the multipleChoice question
3. Submit responses, being sure to put in several different unique inputs for 'Other' (5-10 submissions)
4. View the survey's summary and scroll to the multipleChoice question
- _Observe_: A list of 'Other' user inputs is present, with a 'load more' button

### Expected behavior

No filter is applied

### Other information

One of our surveys has a lot of questions with this 'Other' field. Most of the time I want to keep the full summary, but only view all the 'Other' inputs, then keep scrolling through the rest of the data.

With the way it functions now, I have to:
1. Scroll to the question
2. Click load more to see all the inputs
3. Scroll back to the top of the page to clear the filter
4. Scroll back down to the next question and start over

**NOTE**: This only occurs on miltupleChoice type questions. openText type questions with a 'load more' button simply expand the list without applying a filter.

2522780797,3140,[FEATURE] Make Matrix types wider on Desktops,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Users of our surveys conveyed how difficult it is to pick options in the matrix questions on Desktop, due to the width.

I also have frustrations with it since you have to constantly scroll left/right to read the row's text and pick one of the last options.

IMO, the row text is also clunky looking due to being split up into several lines when there is plenty of real-estate on the screen for most of it to fit without scrollbars. It's fine if the row labels break to newlines, but the width shouldn't be limited to 50px.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Allow the width of the Matrix containers to expand to fit its content better

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

Example matrix from one of my surveys. There are 6 columns in this one, but we have another matrix with 10 columns.

Note the constricted row labels and imagine being a less-than-savvy computer user having to scroll around all the time just to pick an option. Most people don't know that SHIFT+Scroll will scroll horizontally to make it easier, but even using that it is cumbersome to fill out the matrices.

I would expect that container to expand way more to the left/right of the screen since there is plenty of room available.",,
2521656344,3134,[BUG] Device Info Overflowing for Long URLs,"### Issue Summary

When a response came from a long URL the device info tooltip overflows.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a response on a page with a long URL (e.g. http://localhost:3002/website?formbricksDebug=true&looooooooongstring=looooooooongstring&looooooooongstring2=looooooooongstring2&looooooooongstring3=looooooooongstring3)
2. View device details tooltip for that trip
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e80d1e6-db13-49a7-be6c-3d34c335ff54)



### Expected behavior

Tooltip does not overflow. My preferred solution would be to just cut off long URLs and have it as a title.

2519711698,3129,[FEATURE] Improve Survey Overview Dashboard with Detailed Analytics,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I would like to propose an enhancement to the survey overview dashboard to align more closely with your product vision of a fully-fledged Experience Management solution. This feature would provide more comprehensive insights into survey performance, improving users' ability to monitor engagement and satisfaction over time.

### Describe the solution you'd like

- Display & Response Count Over Time
  - Add a chart that tracks both the number of survey displays and responses over time.
  - This feature would allow users to easily identify trends, such as decreasing engagement or potential issues with specific survey campaigns.
- Ratings Over Time
  - For surveys with rating questions, include a graph showing the average ratings over time.
  - This would help us visualize shifts in customer satisfaction and pinpoint moments where satisfaction increases or drops.

2519626846,3128,[BUG] Display Creation Fails with invalid CUID 🚨 ,"### Issue Summary

I'm currently investigating why the display count is broken for some surveys.
I will take the survey `ign1eyhugb9xouy1986peg0m` as an example. The cuid of this survey has been generated by Formbricks but the validation within `ZDisplayCreateInput` fails.

https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/c53b58c64f8b9fcefa9c31694913077e09a7b96b/packages/types/displays.ts#L15


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Send the following CURL request:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app.formbricks.com/api/v1/client/cm0xtgl0u000008jv560ed7qq/displays \
  --data '{""surveyId"":""ign1eyhugb9xouy1986peg0m""}'
```
(Note that the environmentID `cm0xtgl0u000008jv560ed7qq` does not exist and I just generated it on https://www.getuniqueid.com/cuid)
Request fails with the following error message although `ign1eyhugb9xouy1986peg0m` is the id of a survey in our instance:
```
{
	""code"": ""bad_request"",
	""message"": ""Fields are missing or incorrectly formatted"",
	""details"": {
		""surveyId"": ""Invalid cuid""
	}
}
```

2. The cuid validation works when testing it with a different cuid:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app.formbricks.com/api/v1/client/cm0xtgl0u000008jv560ed7qq/displays \
  --data '{""surveyId"":""cm0xtgl0u000008jv560ed7qq""}'
```
This request will lead to an internal server error (but the request validates successfully)
```
{
	""code"": ""internal_server_error"",
	""message"": ""\nInvalid `prisma.display.create()` invocation:\n\n\nAn operation failed because it depends on one or more records that were required but not found. No 'Survey' record(s) (needed to inline the relation on 'Display' record(s)) was found for a nested connect on one-to-many relation 'DisplayToSurvey'."",
	""details"": {}
}
```

### Expected behavior

When providing a valid environment ID and a valid survey ID the request validates.

When providing an invalid environment ID or invalid survey ID the request does not validate.

Currently you can create a Display for any survey (even with a bogus environment ID) and when providing a bogus survey ID it still tries to create the Display (which leads to an internal server error).

### Other information

I guess that `prisma` sometimes generates cuids that are marked as invalid by `zod`.

2518402239,3124,[FEATURE] Unified product space for public website and web app surveys,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Formbricks requires users to create a separate product space for a public website versus a web app (with identified users). For users that have a public website (i.e. a landing page) and a web application, this separation creates fragmentation when it comes to managing the surveys. Especially for users who build and ship multiple products, where each may have a related public website where they also want to collect insights from (i.e. marketing attribution).

### Describe the solution you'd like

Since the SDK already supports both public websites and web apps as is, it would be great to unify the product experience and allow users to create and mange the surveys for both within the same product space.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

As a workaround, I've considered assigning random UUIDs to non-users that are on my public website so that I can manage the surveys for the website within my web app product space.

2518366853,3123,"[BUG] Unable to create a response through API, ""Survey is part of another environment"" when keys and survey are in same environment","### Issue Summary

I manually entered a response to a new survey using the web UI, then retrieved the response json from the API. I then copied the question data from the API response to build a json body for the Create Response endpoint.

Using the `surveyId` field from the response, I tried to create a new response using the API but receive this error:

```json
{
  ""code"": ""bad_request"",
  ""message"": ""Survey is part of another environment"",
  ""details"": {
    ""survey.environmentId"": ""dsjfklsjdflkjsdfj"", // This matches environmentId in my survey's URL, and survey data API response
    ""environmentId"": ""slkdjfklsdjfslkdjf"" // For some reason this is actually the surveyId, but labelled as environmentId
  }
}
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create new survey in Production
2. Create new API key in Production
3. Create a new **Response** manually using the Web UI
4. Get the **Response** data from the API
5. Get the survey data from the API, confirm the `id` field matches the `surveyId` field in **Response** data
6. Use the **Response** data to build json to create a response using the API
7. Try to create a new response, populating `surveyId` in the request with the `surveyId` in the **Response** data

### Expected behavior

A new response is created, no errors

### Other information

My API key and Survey are both created in Production, and the `survey.environmentId` value matches the ID of Production in the webpage URLs.

What's interesting is the `environmentId` key is populated with the `surveyId` in responses / `id` when I get the survey data from the API.

1. Is that key correct? If so, why is the `environmentId` identical to `surveyId`?
2. I've never switched to Development environment since I've had this instance running, and have created several API keys in Production, but they all fail the same way.
3. Any other ID I copy from the survey data API response I get a different error stating that the survey can't be found.

2516873648,3122,[BUG] it's possible to save a published survey without a trigger,"### Issue Summary

It is possible to get a survey into a state where it is published and also has no trigger

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create and publish a survey; its details don't matter so you can use 'Start from scratch', set its trigger, and publish it
2. Edit the newly created/published survey
3. Remove its Survey Trigger
4. Click the Back button
5. Click the Save button on the modal that is displayed
6. The survey now has no Survey Trigger and is still published, confirmable by going back into Edit mode and viewing the Settings tab

### Expected behavior

Clicking the back button while a published survey has no trigger should cause the modal to either:
A) Have the Save button also be disabled, like the top right Save / Save & Close buttons
B) Change the behavior of the Save button to also un-publish the survey

If option A is chosen, I think a short indication of why the button is disabled would be helpful.

If option B is chosen, I think some prompt/confirmation/indication would be helpful to keep people from un-knowingly un-publishing their surveys. Relying only on the ""In-progress"" indicator next to the survey's Edit button may not be enough, since the survey was not explicitly/manually un-published in this scenario.

A few Formbricks users have raised the request to be able to set custom option values for the multi-choice select questions(single-select and multi-select) to enable the setting of a value different from the label. This could increase the utility of the question by storing the desired value against the question id.

### Describe the solution you'd like

We'd like to have a text input field against each option, which should take the value for the option.
By default, the value must equal the option label(if the input box is left unfilled).

2475142278,3032,[BUG] Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set,"

### Issue Summary

The department of health in Hong Kong reported the following issue:

**Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set**

```
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
```

Please fix the issue using these chatGPT suggestions:

To address the issue of the Content Security Policy (CSP) header not being set, you need to configure your web server or application to include a CSP header in HTTP responses. This header helps protect your site from a variety of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

Here's how you can set the CSP header in a Next.js application and at the proxy level using Traefik.

### Setting CSP in Next.js

1. **Open or create** the `next.config.js` file at the root of your Next.js project.

2. **Add the headers configuration** to set the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Here's an example:

```javascript
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        // Apply these headers to all routes in your application
        source: ""/(.*)"",
        headers: [
          {
            key: ""Content-Security-Policy"",
            value: ""default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none';"",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

### Explanation of CSP Directives

- **default-src 'self'**: Allows content only from the origin site.
- **script-src 'self'**: Allows scripts only from the origin site.
- **style-src 'self'**: Allows styles only from the origin site.
- **img-src 'self' data:**: Allows images from the origin site and data URIs.
- **font-src 'self'**: Allows fonts only from the origin site.
- **frame-src 'none'**: Prevents embedding the site in iframes.
- **object-src 'none'**: Disallows embedding objects like Flash or Java applets.

### Summary

1. **Determine the required CSP**: Identify the sources of content your application needs to load (scripts, styles, images, etc.).
2. **Set the CSP Header**: Configure the CSP header in your Next.js application.
3. **Test the CSP**: Use browser developer tools to verify that the CSP header is being applied and monitor for any violations.

By properly setting the CSP header, you add an important layer of security to your web application, helping to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.


### Steps to Reproduce

1. (for example) Went to ...
2. Clicked on...
3. ...


### Expected behavior

CSP header should be present

Configure through an environment variable like ""S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE"". It would be disabled by default : 
`S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=0`

Use it when the client is instantiated in s3 service with the `s3ForcePathStyle` constructor parameter

### Describe the solution you'd like

See how Outline has solved it here by fetching info directly from GitHub API: https://github.com/outline/outline/blob/main/app/components/Sidebar/components/Version.tsx

It will only show if you are not on the latest version. I am not sure how to take Formbricks Cloud into account, and if it follows the same versioning/release system.

2463320657,3008,[BUG] Wordpress Plugin uses old version of formbricks-js,"### Issue Summary

The Formbricks Wordpress Plugin ( https://github.com/formbricks/wordpress ) uses an old version of `formbricks-js` which leads to it not working with the latest version of Formbricks.
With Formbricks 2.0 we introduces a new approach, where we load the formbricks-js code (`js-core`) on demand from the given app hostname (e.g. `https://app.formbricks.com`).
This leads to the wordpress plugin not supporting the latest features plus sometimes even throwing errors because of compatibility issues.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install a new instance of Formbricks
2. Install the Formbricks Wordpress Plugin and configure it to use Formbricks cloud.


### Expected behavior

The Wordpress plugin should also use the new approach for Formbricks > 2.0 loading the js code from the Formbricks instance (Cloud or self-hosted) by accessing the script at `/api/packages/website` (e.g. `https://app.formbricks.com/api/packages/website` for Formbricks Cloud)

In the Wordpress plugin this can happen similar to what we do with the HTML embed ( https://formbricks.com/docs/website-surveys/framework-guides#html ) where the script is loaded from `/api/packages/website` and and init call is made afterwards.

Please update the Wordpress plugin to work with this approach.

2448130977,2961,[BUG] Migration Fails When Formbricks Is Not yet on Latest Version,"### Issue Summary

The database migrations are currently separated into migrations that run within Formbricks and migrations that run within data-migrations. In order to run data-migrations you have to start the Formbricks container on the latest version first. But Formbricks does not work properly as long as data-migrations is not finished. This leads to issues when you try to run the migrations.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run data-migrations without running Formbricks on the latest version
2. Migration fails bc some migrations applied by Formbricks are missing


### Expected behavior

data-migrations runs all necessary migrations without the need to run Formbricks on the latest version first.

Our goal is to have all of our UI components in Storybook so that we have a good overview of them all in one place.

### Describe the solution you'd like

To get one step closer to this goal, please add the `packages/ui/Modal` component to Storybook by adding a `stories.ts` file to the component folder that shows the different variants and different argument combinations that this component can have.
Make sure to follow best practices for storybook.

As an example, take a look at the Button component in `packages/ui/Button` where we already implemented a `stories.ts` file.

2442734061,2946,[FEATURE] Survey Type: Feedback widget - aka minimized survey,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

- A 'normal' intercept survey can be too distracting if shown too often to users. 
- Users still want to give feedback through a survey, but have already closed/not used the survey.

Hence, having an option that is always visible but not too distracting is beneficial, but not currently supported. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

I propose a feedback widget which basically serves as a 'minimized' survey, which after click can open up to a general survey already provided by formbricks. This widget will not be too distracting to users who don't want to use it, but will be readily available if the situation arrises to give feedback.

When the connection to the Redis server times out due to some error (e.g. Redis overloaded etc.) Formbricks does not properly detect that and does not fall back to LRU caching.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run Formbricks with Redis
2. Turn off Redis
3. Formbricks no longer usable since it always tries to reconnect to Redis and will throw tons of errors like:
`Failed to update prerender cache for xyz Error: Redis client is not ready yet or connection is lost. Keep trying...`


### Expected behavior

When connection to Redis is lost it should fall back to LRU making sure there is at least one caching option available.

2407043406,2886,[BUG] Delete tags not working once merge operation is completed.,"### Issue Summary

So I created 6 tags, and merged the first tag with the 6th tag. In this process found some issues I wanted to bring up: 
1. Once a tag is merged then why is it still being visible in the UI. What I mean is if `tag1` is merged with `tag6` then only `tag6` should be visible. 
2. Even if `tag1` is visible after merge why is there a delete and merge button next to the tag. As far as I have understood the tag should not have these buttons after merge. The main issue what we face here is even if the user tries to delete the tag it won't be deleted. Only the tag it was merged with can be deleted.
3. Also the toast message needs to updated and needs to send a better message if merge is done again. 

My fix will be is to remove the tag from the UI once it's merged then all these issues won't be reproducible.

## Preview

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add multiple tags for a response.
2. Edit tags -> Merge one tag with another.
3. Delete a tag once merged or merge the same tag with another tag or same tag again

### Expected behavior

Once a tag is merge it should not be visible in the UI. The user should not be able to delete or merge the tag again

2406842007,2884,[BUG] Tag input appears soon after a tag is created,"### Issue Summary

After receiving a response for a survey, if we try to add a tag to the response a weird bug pops up.
So once a tag is created and text box with the tag name appears for some brief seconds, The issue here is if user tries to create tags using keyboard actions and clicked on return once a tag is created and requested will be made ti create the same tag again for the text box that appears, This causes a issue as tag with same name cannot be created. This is UI issue so that the  text box does'nt appear in the first place

## Preview: 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73cd9b5e-ff46-4814-8181-554e126928c0




### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Survey and Publish it
2. Complete the survey which will send a response for the created survey
3. Once the response is received, head back to the survey in dashboard and check the responses for the survey.
4. for the recieved response add a tag
5. after adding a tag a text box appears and later disappears. 

### Expected behavior

Once the tag is created the textbox should not appear, as this can lead to creation of duplicate tag which is not allowed, This will throw an error which will lead to poor User experience.

2403871795,2880,[BUG] NEXTAUTH_URL is missing/not set in Docker image,"### Issue Summary

The Azure AD OAuth mechanism sends what looks like a hardcoded localhost address as the redirect URI when trying to sign in. However, I am not hosted at localhost and need it to redirect to the WEBAPP_URL that I specified in the Docker Compose yml.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup Azure Tenant according to the [Formbricks Docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration#azure-sso-o-auth)
- _Observe_: issues from #2879 
2. Input the Client ID/Secret and Tenant ID to Formbricks
3. Give Microsoft Entra ID an arbitrary redirect URL to your domain (the docs don't specify what the URI should be)
4. Disable all other authentication methods
5. Spin up the Formbricks service, then go to the URL for the setup wizard
6. Attempt to sign-in using Azure
- _Observe_: Microsoft error stating that the redirect URL does not match, gives an error that appears to indicate localhost might be hardcoded somewhere (or the `WEBAPP_URL` variable does not work)

Error Text:
```plaintext
AADSTS50011: The redirect URI 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/azure-ad' specified in the request does not match the redirect URIs configured for the application 'MY-APP-UUID'. Make sure the redirect URI sent in the request matches one added to your application in the Azure portal. 
```

### Expected behavior

The redirect URL mentioned in the error message uses my defined `WEBAPP_URL`

### Other information

I am not sure yet if localhost is hardcoded in the Azure mechanism, or if the Docker setup just isn't using this variable at all for anything. I will try to take a look through the repo and report back which it might be.

2403764786,2879,"[BUG] Azure AD does not function out of the box, documentation is missing important steps","### Issue Summary

Using the documentation, the Azure AD integration does not function. The documentation is missing steps and information for the redirect URL that is needed.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup Azure Tenant according to the [Formbricks Docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration#azure-sso-o-auth)
- _Observe_: Docs say to get your IDs from Azure (which is now called Microsoft Entra ID), but the Client Secret doesn't exist without first [creating a new App Registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scenario-web-app-sign-user-app-registration?tabs=aspnetcore#register-an-app-by-using-the-azure-portal). Then you can generate a new Client Secret to use.
2. Input the Client ID/Secret and Tenant ID to Formbricks
3. Disable all other authentication methods
4. Spin up the Formbricks service, then go to the URL for the setup wizard
5. Attempt to sign-in using Azure
- _Observe_: Microsoft error stating that a reply address is missing
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/164041490/780bae9c-bca5-4b2d-ba78-8c6bf7ee13ca)

### Expected behavior

The documentation outlines all the necessary steps for setting up an Azure Tenant, especially including the important steps for:
* Registering a new app
* Generating a client secret
* Where to find your client ID and tenant ID
* Adding a redirect URL

Otherwise, I would expect the login to succeed as long as I copy and pasted my secrets properly and followed the documentation exactly.

### Other information

The Microsoft error is specifically referring to a Redirect URL that is needed. I have several other Azure AD OAuth integrations in place, and they all require a unique redirect URL. The docs do not mention what this redirect URL should be anywhere.

2395681265,2858,[BUG] Docker Image --> SMTP Mail Config to send Unauthorized //  Error: unable to verify the first certificate ,"### Issue Summary

Hi everyone, 

I use several docker images on this particular Docker host. I'm successfully using SMTP to an internal Exchange server as well from different images on this server. Due to the hoster's config I have to send these Mails without auth on port 25. 
In Formbricks I always receive the following error: 

Error: unable to verify the first certificate 

As I found out this error message is thrown due to a missing TLS config: 

 tls: {
            // do not fail on invalid certs
            rejectUnauthorized: false
        },

I cannot find an .env variable in docker-compose.yml to configure rejectUnauthorized. Is there any way for me to fix it, or do I have to fork formbricks, change the index.tsx in packages/email/ and docker-compose the new image?

The rest is working correct, except from the upload of background images (which I do not need). 

Thanks in advance! Cheers

Robin 

### Steps to Reproduce

I used docker-compose.yml to build the container. 
Email config: 
    # Email Configuration
    MAIL_FROM: ""xxx@xxx""
    SMTP_HOST: ""xxx-xxx.xxx.org""
    SMTP_PORT: 25
    #SMTP_USER: ""xxx""
    #SMTP_PASSWORD: ""xxx""

    # (Additional option for TLS (port 465) only)
    SMTP_SECURE_ENABLED: 0

On other containers the smtp config is working (SSL false, TLS false, host and port are the same, no auth)

Send email instead of error msg

Struggling a lot with users filling out addresses and getting certain things wrong - meaning that automations after the form fail, which makes it almost take longer than getting details manually!

### Describe the solution you'd like

I've seen solutions online where the address input uses Google Maps, provides a list of addresses, and autofills the City, Province/State, Postal/Zip Code, etc. This way definitely isn't foolproof, but it'll prevent misspelling on the address

2365131817,2793,[FEATURE] Pop-up builder,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

No

### Describe the solution you'd like

Have the ability to display pop-ups with texts, buttons, fields, images, etc. to show information to the user, like promotions, hints/tips, a welcome message, etc. The idea is similar to [GetSiteControl](https://getsitecontrol.com), [Popupsmart](https://popupsmart.com), [plum](https://plumpopup.com/) and many others.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

I think that is not a hard feature to implement because the user segmentation that you have (metadata and segments), the actions and all the logic you already implemented for surveys can fit perfectly to pop-ups.
There are some open source no-code builders (like https://github.com/NiazMorshed2007/popwola) that can be implemented and improved to add it to Formbricks.",,

When going back and forth between tiles, the background tiles sometimes do not resize properly.

### Steps to Reproduce

I was able to reproduce the issue with this setup, I guess it also affects other flows:
1. Create a survey with logic jump and star rating question just like in the video
2. Select 5 stars -> tiles resize properly
3. Go back and select 3 stars (jump to different question) -> tile resizes properly
4. Go back and select 5 stars again -> tiles do not resize properly

2357797946,2776,[BUG] Google Translate issue,"### Issue Summary

Hi, team.

We released a survey in our language (pt_BR) , wich is the same as our audience.
However, some users reported duplicated text in some components, as shown here
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/7780778/0e50d73d-781b-4c9d-b502-7c0671259f60)

In our investigation we found out that this behaviou is caused by Google translate kicking in on some browsers.
Due to the user configuration (auto translate) and the fact that there is a label (Press Enter) present in the greeting card + the Formbrick branding.

We customized the labels for Next and Back buttons, but we were not able to customize the ""Press Enter"" message.
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/7780778/987c6acc-1e84-4437-939c-c0cb4b7978a8)

This is not related to multi language surveys. 

Suggestions: 
- Allow the customization of the ""Press Enter"" message.
- Allow setting the language tag  `<html lang=""en"">`

Thanks.


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Access a survey in a language other than English.
2. Accept google chrome's suggestion to translate to ""your language"", the same as the survey.
3. Move your mouse (until you move nothing happens).


### Expected behavior

No duplicated text is displayed.

We do not have Mail configured and do not wish to configure it as we do not see the additional value. Currently, our logs are getting spammed with messages like: `Could not Email :: SMTP not configured :: [...]`
This clutter makes it harder to identify other important log messages.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Introduce a new environment variable, DISABLE_MAIL. When this variable is set:

- The notification settings related to email are disabled in the frontend.
- The application does not attempt to send emails.

Benefits:

- Cleaner logs without unnecessary error messages.
- A more user-friendly configuration for teams not using the mail feature.

2350809580,2765,[FEATURE] Separate Public & Private S3 Bucket,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, the same S3 bucket is used for both private data (file exports) and public assets (uploaded images). This approach has several drawbacks:

- Security Risk: Private data should ideally be deleted after the download is completed to prevent unauthorized access. Using the same bucket for both private and public data increases the risk of data leakage.
- Performance and URL Management: Public assets would benefit from being served via CloudFront with a clean URL and efficient caching.
- Adding a Cloudfront distribution could potentially leak files from the /private folder.

### Describe the solution you'd like

1. Private Data Handling:
 - Store private data in a temporary folder within the Docker container.
 - Ensure this data is deleted on container restart to reduce the chance of data leakage.
2. Public Files Management:
 - Serve public files via a separate S3 bucket.
 - Allow users to configure this S3 bucket to use CloudFront for distribution to eliminate the need for authentication and to implement an efficient caching policy.

Benefits:

- Enhanced security by segregating private and public data.
- Improved performance and user experience with CloudFront's caching capabilities.
- Cleaner URL management for public assets.
- Browser starts caching assets -> reduced bandwidth fees.

2334074484,2730,[BUG] Docker-Compose Deprecation Error in Local Dev Environment,"### Issue Summary

While working on the project, I opted to utilize the local development environment. After cloning the repository and installing the necessary packages, I attempted to initiate the development environment with the `pnpm go` command, which relies on Docker. However, the command failed. Upon investigation, I discovered that the failure was due to the deprecation of the `docker-compose` command in newer versions of Docker.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repo
2. pnpm install
3. Set value of ENCRYPTION_KEY
4. pnpm go 

### Expected behavior

should start a development environment.

### Other information

Below is a basic solution I made to address the issue in the `scripts` property of `packages/databse/package.json`:
```diff
    ""db:push"": ""prisma db push --accept-data-loss"",
-   ""db:up"": ""docker-compose up -d"",
+   ""db:up"": ""docker-compose up -d || docker compose up -d"",
    ""db:setup"": ""pnpm db:up && pnpm db:migrate:dev"",
    ""db:start"": ""pnpm db:setup"",
-   ""db:down"": ""docker-compose down"",
+   ""db:down"": ""docker-compose down || docker compose down"",
    ""format"": ""prisma format"",
    ""generate"": ""prisma generate"",
    ""lint"": ""eslint ./src --fix"",
    ""post-install"": ""pnpm generate"",

### Describe the solution you'd like

1. As you probably already know, we can't embed the pixel compiled as umd on our React website. iife works fine though.
I would therefore appreciate it very much if there was a possibility to include the pixel via iife in the future (e.g. `/api/packages/website?format=iife`).
2. What was the exact reason why you removed the feature to enable initialization directly via the URL? (e.g. `/api/packages/website?format=iife?environment=<abc>`)
3. Currently the `Vary` header, which has been stupidly changed by Nextjs, prevents the resources from being effectively cached by Cloudflare/Cloudfront. Could you please look into patching this si that these resources can be cached by proxies other than Vercel (this is also in your interest so that you are not dependent on the Vercel cache).

2295922009,2622,[BUG] Options order changing & randomized options not working,"### Issue Summary

I'm currently upgrading our instance to 2.0.1 and encountered the following issue:
For this example survey the option order changes on hover:

https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/64426524/1f0f774c-130b-46fb-bdc0-098b5dae4a79




### Steps to Reproduce

1. Trigger survey with ""randomize except last option"" radio select
2. See options order change on mouse hover
3. The options are also not randomized (in this example the 3rd option never changes even when the survey is triggered again)


### Expected behavior

1. order does not change after survey is rendered
2. option order is actually randomized

### Context
The relevant files are these ones:

CalEmbed Question: https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/surveys/src/components/general/CalEmbed.tsx

We use CSS variables to pass the different setting users can use in the Styling tab to the different elements of the survey. The CSS variables can be found in https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/surveys/src/styles/global.css

_Warning: Pedantic UI feedback ahead :)_

At first glance, the download button on the survey response page looks more like a filter than an action due to its chevron icon:

![CleanShot 2024-04-24 at 22 48 13@2x](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/62545933/e48043fc-f548-40a7-bc93-26943721d91d)

This might be misleading and resulted in me missing the feature at first.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I understand that the download options presented after clicking are somewhat related to the filters, and that might be why you have opted to give it a chevron icon. 
But as the downloading itself is an action, it would be better suited with a clearly distinguishable icon IMHO.
The dropdown options seem self-explanatory enough to be understood either way. 

I can see you're using Lucide, and I would suggest `arrow-down-to-line` or `harddrive-download`.

2255559638,2496,[FEATURE] Set Max Character Limit in Open Text Question,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently there are only 2 options ie a higher level Short Text or Long Text Question. What we'd like to have here is to also have the ability to set the maximum input characters in the question. This allows us to make sure the answers don't get too long and avoid spammy answers.

### Describe the solution you'd like

An Input field where I can set the maximum number of characters allowed in Open Text questions and the user cannot fill more than that, if they do, they get an error to reduce it.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Alternative would be to rather just use Short Text questions but then there's no middle ground between the 2 question types that allows customisation

2251423376,2486,[BUG] Class Name Conflicts,"### Issue Summary

Currently, website surveys are displayed incorrectly on websites that inadvertently overwrite tailwind classes.
Suppose developer Dave has added an element that uses the following CSS:
```
.border {
    position:absolute;
    left: 0;
    width:100%;
    height:1px;
    background-color: gray;
}
```
As the survey modal also uses the ""border"" class, this CSS is now also applied to the survey, making the survey completely unusable.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Try to display a survey on a page that has the following CSS:
```
.border {
    position:absolute;
    left: 0;
    width:100%;
    height:1px;
    background-color: gray;
}
```
2. Survey is not usable


### Expected behavior

Surveys look nice on all types of websites (regardless of other CSS on that page).

**Solution:**
Formbricks should encapsulate the survey from the rest of the page. And / or it should not use common class names (""border"" etc.) by eg adding a prefix to the classes to make collisions less likely.

The CSV export contains all the information: answers to questions + metadata (user agent, time etc..) + hidden fields. These last two are missing in the Airtable integration. This information is very useful so it would be great to have it in Airtable.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The Airtable integration should provide options for including the metadata and hidden fields, it would even be fine to always include it since you can easily hide unused columns in Airtable. That would save us from having to change anything to the UI and the integration config.

The following test survey contains a single Call-to-Action question:
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/64426524/9050c77b-3bc8-4ee3-829f-590f2790e94f)

- the survey was displayed 730 times
- the survey was ignored 501 times
- the survey was dismissed 164 times
- users clicked the button 65 times

Out of this I would expect the following numbers:
- Displays: 730
- Starts: 65
- Completions/Responses: 65
- CTR: 8.9%
- Drop Offs: 665
- maybe display the additional number ""Dismissals: 164""

Personally, I find it a bit strange that users who close the survey on the first question are counted as ""response"". In addition, the time to complete does not work at all in this case. Unfortunately, the CTR doesn't really work for surveys with conditional logic either.
~~I would also like the option to mark the CTA question as required.~~
Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to suggest switching to the term ""Impression"" instead of ""Displays / Views"". This is currently not yet used consistently and the term ""Impression"" is the most prevalent in the industry.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. run survey with CTA question
2. check response count and CTR

### Expected behavior

Clicks on the button are counted as responses to that question, the CTR is calculated as (clicks) / (number of impressions).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. create a survey and add logic that creates a loop
2. publish the survey and try to fill it
3. come back to your application


### Expected behavior

If logic is incorporated into a survey, it must conclude appropriately. If logic is added to the majority of the questions, the survey should end properly. However, if there is a loop in the logic or if the final question incorporates logic, it must be thoroughly reviewed before permission is granted to publish the survey.

2200482360,2312,[FEATURE] Add auto-refresh to the analysis view,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently a users needs to do a hard refresh to see new results in the summary and responses view. While for example doing a live survey in front of an audience this isn't ideal.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Let's make periodic requests to the server checking for new responses (e.g. every 10 seconds) and display them when they come in. Since we already have caching built into the services this should only produce a new database call when the responses changed.

### Additions

1. Update the auto-refresh function on modal close

We're refreshing the data when the user closes this modal:
<img width=""1169"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c568171f-3ceb-40e8-9bd9-63e1e66e232f"">

<img width=""338"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eeb8022-fa15-4100-8271-3d31b5caf017"">

Please make sure to update the Summary page as well.

2. Filtering does not effect the count in the tab:
<img width=""588"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1597f628-8016-44ba-a9e1-475f966445e9"">

No matter which filters are set, it shows the total number of responses.

Instead, it  should show ""Responses (3 of 5)"" to indicate that the Response view currently does not show the total number of responses but the filtered down selection (like it actually does).

### Describe alternatives you've considered

We still need to check how complex this is with the current implementation of filtering and pagination. If it's still causing too many server calls that we want to avoid by default we might also add a `live view` toggle which is off by default and can be turned on.

Currently when surveys are deleted, they are gone right away. This could also happen by accident very easily. And with the survey all responses are gone.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Let's build a ""recently deleted surveys"" view. Once a survey is deleted from the default survey list it's status changes to `deleted` with a `deletedAt` timestamp and it gets into the ""recenty deleted"" view. 
In the ""recently deleted"" view users have the option to either remove the survey permanently (like the delete default now) or undo the deletion.
If they take no action a cron that runs every day permanently deletes the surveys where the `deletedAt` timestamp is older than 7 days.

### Technical Considerations

- Most images on Unsplash have a very high resolution (4000x6000 pixels). Since we do not resize images, the size effects the loading time of the survey. To keep the loading times short, please make sure to not request the images not in full size but  in 1920x1080 pixels (or what Unsplash calls ""M"").

- The feature should only be enabled if a UNSPLASH_API_KEY is present in the environment variables.

Here is all the info you need to create a free Unsplash Account to get Demo access to their API:

2190181609,2264,[BUG] on-the-fly triggers do not work with displayPercentage,"### Issue Summary

When you use an on-the-fly URL trigger the survey does not take the displayPercentage into account.
The issue is that renderWidget is called for inline triggers: [https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/js/src/lib/noCodeActions.ts#L63](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/js/src/lib/noCodeActions.ts#L63)

suggestion: I know this might be a bit late, but I think a different architecture for inlineTriggers would be better:

1. Add an attribute `inline` to `ActionClass`. If inline is true, do not show it in the Actions & Attributes panel in the backend and exclude from action search.
2. Add an option to the survey editor to add a trigger, these actions will be inline (but only visible for this survey).
3. The sync API should return inline actions just like normal actions.
   This has the following advantages: a) every feature for reusable action will also work for inline actions and vice versa and b) it reduces complexity and reduces file size of the frontend pixel.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add survey, set displayPercentage to 1%, set URL on-the-fly trigger.
2. Open targeted page.
3. Survey pops up.

### Expected behavior

expected:
Survey pops up in 1% of page loads.

[Some contributors](https://discord.com/channels/979077669410979880/1165191112177233970/1165191112177233970) are facing issues when trying to get Prisma to connect to the database (as part of running the `pnpm go`) running in the Docker's container on WSL2. This happens if WSL2 has its own PostgreSQL service up and running. 

To fix this, before running `pnpm go`, WSL2 contributors should make sure they stop the WSL2 Postgres service running: `sudo systemctl stop postgresql`

I suggest adding a side note for the WSL2 in the documentation around the `pnpm go` command: Contributing > Setup Dev Environment > Local Machine Setup.




### Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a postgres service installed and running in WSL2
2. Follow the steps on https://formbricks.com/docs/contributing/setup#local-machine-setup
3. After running `pnpm go` you will receive the following error: `Error: P1000: Authentication failed against database server at 'localhost', the provided database credentials for 'postgres' are not valid.`

I started using the cloud instance yesterday, and unfortunately I've had continuous intermittent issues with images I've uploaded not loading in various places. For example, even my profile picture doesn't load now, console error `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 ()`.

Or the survey I created for people to pick between different pictures doesn't always load images, this has occurred on android, ios and desktop devices. I even recreated the survey a second time, uploading the images again and also compressing them down, still having this issue.

I have the need to ask survey respondents for either their rating or preference of an image (e.g. website screenshot). The problem is that these images are small in scale and cannot be increased in size. Any detailed information (for example asking a preference for two prototypes with a small visual change) cannot be comprehended by respondents. Most (all) image related questions are thus not feasible for me.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Allow respondents to increase the size of the image. Could be feasible by a larger popup window, or a new tab (desktop) when picture is clicked. 

Example: in Hotjar, if you hover over the image, you see the CTA to open in new tab.

2160798619,2158,[FEATURE] Progressive In-App Survey: continue in-app / website survey in new full page tab,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

This proposal outlines a feature that can improve user completion rates for lengthy in-app surveys by reducing distractions and providing a more focused experience.

**Problem**
Users filling out long in-app surveys often abandon them due to:
- Distractions: Surrounding page elements can distract users and lead to incomplete surveys.
- Information overload: Presenting all questions at once can overwhelm users, decreasing motivation to complete.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Implement a ""Progressive In-App Survey"" feature that:

1. **Starts in-app**: Users begin the survey within the webapp, maintaining the context of their experience.
2. **Opens follow-up sections in a new tab**: After completing a section, users click a button to proceed. This triggers the next section to load in a new full-page tab, reducing distractions and clutter.
3. **Prefills previous answers**: Automatically carry over user responses from previous sections to the new tab, ensuring seamless continuation.

**Benefits**

- Improved completion rates: Reduces distractions and information overload, leading to higher completion rates.
- Enhanced user experience: Provides a more focused and streamlined survey experience.
- Increased data collection: Enables collecting comprehensive data even for lengthy surveys.

**Additional Notes**
This feature is not critical but could significantly enhance the user experience and data collection process.
Open to further discussion and refinement of the proposed solution.

I highly appreciate being able to create custom actions on the fly with the newest update.

<img width=""469"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/b347eab3-bf76-471f-9e2e-44148195c862"">

On click, the upload mask opens which only allows .png and .jpeg files. 

**Logo Settings**

Once an image file was selected and uploaded, this modal opens:
<img width=""777"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/b06abb9f-2a6d-4d95-90ae-487040b0aabd"">

1. Replace logo: Opens the upload modal again to replace logo
2. Remove logo: Replaces the preview with our standard file upload UI (find it in `packages/ui`). However, the logo file is not deleted on button click, this happens only on ""Save"". Otherwise ""Cancel"" cannot undo it.
3. Background color: Default #ffffff, affects the background color of the container holding the logo

The rest of the UI should be self-explanatory. On SAVE the logo is displayed accordingly in the top left corner of the link survey preview. 

On HOVER on the logo, we see an EDIT icon button which opens the same settings modal:

<img width=""998"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/3b6a3efe-7e00-4f2d-beae-adb00ffda0c4"">

In the Styling Card in the survey settings, we add a ""Hide logo"" toggle if the product has a logo:

<img width=""548"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/09feb38e-1e97-4cde-9400-1824b127d1e3"">

The toggle hides the logo in this specific survey :)

----------

**Product Settings > Look & Feel Page**
We also allow to add the logo on the Look & Feel page in the Product Settings. The card looks like this at first:

<img width=""701"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/9b4938e8-f65a-4da2-84aa-75bc75ea548c"">

Once the user uploaded an image we see the editor:

<img width=""669"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/9c5bba77-7422-428c-b481-66dde2d258ce"">

After save, we can see the preview and the color but cannot make changes without hitting ""Edit"":

<img width=""667"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/72809645/6135b322-3550-4c5f-bb00-0a68e74118a3"">

--------

In the `LinkSurvey.tsx` display the logo if there is one for the product and the survey styling has showLogo enabled. It should be displayed in the top left corner of the page. Make sure it works well responsively.

--------

**Data Model**

Please extend the `Product` model in prisma with a new JSON object `brand`:

```
""brand"": {
  ""logoUrl"": ""..."",
  ""bgColor"": ""#ffffff"",
}
```

In the styling JSON in the `Survey` model we set the variable `showLogo` to true for all new surveys. If  the variable is not set, we don't display the logo. In the settings in the Styling card we can set it to false by toggling off.

---------

**Team Roles**
We have team roles with different rights. Only render the card in the look and feel settings as well as the ""Add logo here"" indicator in the survey editor when the logged in user is a Developer, Editor or Admin (so not a Viewer).

---------

**How we code at Formbricks**
1. To keep our code DRY, create the UI we need both in the survey editor and the settings page in the `packages/ui` folder and import it back into the Formbricks app to use it.
2. Upload functionality: We're using it in several place in the app, stick to the same process to keep it consistent.

2150702446,2116,[BUG] Show an error 'Email verification is pending' when logging in,"### Issue Summary

If I start formbricks with EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED and create an account, then stop formbricks and set EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED to 1, and start formbricks, when i try to login with the account i created when email verification was disabled i get an error 'Email verification is pending'. It because the account is not verified but formbricks does not send an email for me to verify the account.

### Steps to Reproduce

2. Then set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED=0` and restart formbricks.
3. Try to login with the account you created.

To get Formbricks to boot again, I had to revert to the 1.5.0 image in my Compose file, and run this command before starting the Compose instance again:
`sudo docker compose run formbricks pnpm dlx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back ""20240204084813_remove_creator_cascade_delete_in_survey""`

### Steps to Reproduce

1. `docker compose down`
2. `docker compose pull` to get latest Formbricks image (1.5.1)
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. Error is thrown and Formbricks container does not start

### Expected behavior

Formbricks should start without migration issues

### Other information

After reverting back to 1.5.0, and rolling back the migration as above, Formbricks works fine.

2115314935,2004,[FEATURE] Allow scoring of answers,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

If I want to do a quiz or a test (e.g. Mulitple and Single Choice Questions) I would like to set a score for each possible answer. In the end the sum of the scores can be weighted and set for a pass or fail.

Obviously the logic should be able to handle the value.

### Describe the solution you'd like

For every Multiple Choice or Single Choice Answer, allow setting a numeric value as the answer score.

Allow setting a logic depending on the scoring value:
e.g. go to welcome screen if total value < 80 and go to final screen if value > 80

Allow logic routing based on given answers or points, Ideally there can be two different final screens depending on the logic, if failed.

Filling out the form:
Automatically add the scoring values of the selected the answers along the way. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Routing based on answers is also possible. But that would result in immediate feedback if the the wrong answer was given and the test can not be completed without knowing all answers.

Alternatively the scoring of answers can also be used to calculate things like engagement value, for scoring of leads in a sales process or such things.

2114746092,2001,[FOR-1825] [FEATURE] Question Type: Ranking,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Let's say that I have a list of 10 features and I would like the respondent to rank the features in order of importance for them. 

Example questions:
""If i have a set of features, e.g. responsive forms, flexible respondent pricing, embedding, emailing, etc. could you please rank which are most important for you?""

""Based on your own time management, please rank in order of importance: design, coding, internal communication, team management, etc.""

### Describe the solution you'd like

We need a question type: Ranking

Build a new Formbricks Question type for Ranking Questions (in the Editor as well as the Surveys package).

## UX Notes
To start with, we will enable a way of sorting which does not include Drag and Drop. I find DnD to break easily and often it's not really well done. Also, the surveys will run on a lot of different devices and platforms so solving it without an additional library should be preferred. We do the following:

### Click to sort
When a respondent is asked to sort something, they do it in two steps: Initial sorting and fine-tuning. Our sorting needs to allow both.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f4898e3-20d8-4142-90fd-9838e710826c)

**Initial sorting**
Very straight forward: The first element you click on is sorted first, the next you click on becomes second, etc.

The new option has two new elements: A circle on the right (which is a bit bigger and has a dashed stroke then single choice) and two arrow buttons:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b702ba81-a8b3-413b-afd9-6d819d051302)

If clicked, it looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a00c4ce-787f-47c1-9b22-0815023273ac)

Here is the UX:
1. Once the respondent clicks on the first option, we mark it with 1 on the left hand side, **but do not yet resort cause it would confuse the respondents.**
2. Once the respondent clicks on the second option, we sort the first option to the top and the second  below the first. This assures that they understand how the click-to-sort-thing works.
3. For all following elements we sort them up right after the click on it.
4. The arrows are very straight-forward: Once the user clicked on up or down, the option moves up or down and gets a number.

Please make sure to properly test the different edge cases of which there are quite a few.

**CSS Animations**
- Make sure to use CSS Animations to make the resorting look nicer.

**Error messages**
If the question is required, all options need to be sorted.

### RankingQuestionForm
The form to create a ranking type question should be identical to the one for Single Select incl. the option to randomize:

<img width=""696"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0cd2ac-1595-45b1-918d-605c19f5b9b9"">

### Summary and Response Card
The summary should follow this pattern:
<img width=""536"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/232e189d-108b-4858-a660-add3806ded24"">

Formbricks currently only supports local file storage or AWS S3.

2114714585,1999,[FEATURE] Introduce Frontend-Exclusive Attributes for Enhanced User Interaction,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

We propose the implementation of frontend-only attributes to enhance user customization and interaction. This feature will empower developers to dynamically set attributes specific to the frontend, enabling targeted survey triggers based on user-defined criteria. Additionally, metadata from these attributes can be added to survey responses from frontend to backend, facilitating a smoother integration between the two.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Introduce a method, perhaps named `formbricks.setFrontendAttribute(key, value)`, to enable the definition of frontend-only attributes. These attributes will be applicable only during the current page view, providing a localized and dynamic user experience.
With frontend-only attributes, developers can leverage these key-value pairs to finely tune survey triggers. For instance, a survey could be triggered based on specific conditions, such as displaying it only when the 'bucket' attribute is equal to '0' and the 'language' attribute equals 'EN'. This granular control enhances the precision of user engagement strategies.
When a user responds to a survey, the current set of frontend attributes should be automatically included as metadata in the survey response. This integration ensures that valuable user context is seamlessly passed from the frontend to the backend, facilitating further analysis and decision-making.

2101890074,1967,[FEATURE] Enhance Action/Trigger Management for Scalability,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

The current approach for defining actions and triggers lacks scalability, particularly in cases where actions are predominantly single-use and specific to individual surveys. To address this, we propose an enhancement that combines reusable actions on a dedicated Actions page with the ability to create on-the-fly, single-use triggers directly within survey settings.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The proposed solution aims to improve the scalability of action and trigger management by introducing the following features:

**Reusable Actions/Triggers:**
Users can define and manage reusable actions/triggers on the Actions page, streamlining the process for scenarios where actions are shared across multiple surveys.

**Single-Use Triggers On-the-Fly:**
On the survey settings page, users can create single-use triggers specific to that survey, eliminating clutter by keeping survey-specific actions isolated.

2101372212,1963,[BUG] Phone Field Usability,"### Issue Summary

The phone field type is strangely difficult to use. It does validation that requires a country code, which, in the USA is very uncommon for non-technical people to enter. As a result it causes a lot of churn when people can't figure out how to get past this validation pattern.

Maybe the phone validatino pattern shouldn't be so strict, or alternatively allow the form creator to specify whether or not they want to collect country code

It would be great to have a feature that allows the targeted display of in-app surveys to a specific percentage of users. This functionality, inspired by platforms like Hotjar, would provide more nuanced control over survey distribution.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The envisioned solution involves assigning each user to one of several buckets (e.g., 1-10), and allowing administrators to specify the buckets where the survey should run. This way, precise targeting, such as reaching only 10% of the user base, can be achieved effortlessly.

Our ideal implementation would include the following elements:
1. Users are distributed across buckets (1-10) upon widget initialization.
2. Admins can selectively choose which buckets the survey should be displayed to, enabling percentage-based targeting.

3. Observe that the comment is not immediately displayed.
4. Reload the page.
5. Notice that the comment now appears as expected.


### Expected behavior

Adding a comment to a response should dynamically update the display without requiring a page reload, providing a seamless user experience.

2093916209,1938,[BUG] Filters not applying to Detailed Survey Answers in Responses Tab,"### Issue Summary

I observed that the filters are not functioning as expected for detailed survey answers. They appear to only take effect when navigating from the summary tab.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a survey with an open-text field question (this issue might extend to other question types, though untested).
2. Collect responses to the survey.
3. Navigate to the ""Responses"" tab.
4. Attempt to apply filters.
5. Observe that the filters do not take effect as intended.
6. When applying the filters on the Summary tab and then switching to Responses it does work.

### Expected behavior

Filters should consistently apply to survey answers, irrespective of the current tab.

### Other information

*No response*

The first response should not be visible since the question is skipped.

2092041674,1930,[BUG] when uploading certain files the file upload question breaks the whole survey,"### Issue Summary

After doing a file upload for a video with the size of 43 MB it gives a 400 error. It seems to break with everything of a size that is bigger them 10MB (which is the limit if I am looking into the code). This also happens when uploading a file that has a type that is nog supported (for example .txt).
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/12459538/092b2884-6d91-4a04-bca9-fb15a93891cf)

After I then complete the survey it keeps on saying uploading.

Because of the failed file upload I am unable to see all past responses from the survey.
![image](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/assets/12459538/bfa577b4-7e64-4bc5-8501-d72e125981ed)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new survey with a file upload. (Don't change any question settings).
2. Upload a file which is larger then 10 MB or an unsupported file type (for example .txt) and finish the survey.
3. Try to access the responses of the survey.


### Expected behavior

The video uploads, or it gives a message that it failed to upload. But this should never be able to break the whole survey which restricts access to the previous responses.

### Other information

Also experiencing this issue on my self hosted instance. Temporary work around is to set the max file upload to 10MB. This prevents the uploading from files that are bigger then 10MB. This does not fix the wrong file type issue because this only puts a filter on the input file (which off course can be disabled by selecting ""all file types *.*).

2090210196,1926,[BUG] Share Feature Prone to Misunderstanding,"### Issue Summary

We recently encountered an incident where a user unintentionally exposed survey results to the public while intending to share the survey link internally. This inadvertent action poses a significant risk of data leakage. Fortunately, the survey was not yet live at the time. To enhance the share feature and mitigate such risks, we propose the following adjustments:

* Precise Wording:
  Current: ""Publish Results""
  Proposed: Change to ""Publicly Publish Results""
  Rationale: Adding the term ""Publicly"" helps to clarify the nature of the action, reducing the likelihood of unintentional data exposure.
* Additional Option for Internal Sharing:
  Proposed: Introduce a second option - ""Copy Link for Internal Sharing""
  Rationale: Providing a dedicated option for internal sharing aligns with user expectations and minimizes the risk of accidental public disclosure.
* Warning for Unauthenticated Access:
  Proposed: Include a warning that clarifies results can be accessed without authentication when shared via the link.
  Rationale: Alerting users about potential risks associated with unauthenticated access ensures informed decision-making during the sharing process.
* Enhanced Visibility of Public Results:
  Proposed: Make the public status of results more visible by adding a prominent warning, such as ""Results Currently Set to Public.""
  Rationale: Improved visibility ensures users are aware of the current sharing status, reducing the likelihood of unintentional public sharing.

I can open a pull request to address this if you want.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Click in ""Share""

### Expected behavior

Nobody accidentally publishes results when they just want to share the survey internally.
