2673254420,7071,🐛 Bug Report: ExpressJS Quickstart = Directory Import error on Nodejs v20 and Deno v2,"### 📜 Description

I have an expressjs NodeJS (v20) project with type: module and got import errors following the quickstart guide for express.

https://docs.novu.co/quickstart/express

We are hoping to move to Deno v2 (TypeScript) soon, so I ran the project in Deno + TypeScript and got error:

`error: [ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT] Directory import 'file:///<user>/backend/node_modules/.deno/@novu+shared@2.1.2/node_modules/@novu/shared/dist/esm/config' is not supported resolving ES modules imported from 'file:///<user>/backend/node_modules/.deno/@novu+shared@2.1.2/node_modules/@novu/shared/dist/esm/index.js'`

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Run expressjs in Node.js v20 and set `""type"": ""module"",`.

OR

Setup expressjs in Deno V2 using TypeScript

Quickstart guide for express and has export error in both.

2648314077,6915,🚀 Feature: Digest/Wait Until,"### 🔖 Feature description

We would like to see a callback function to check if a condition is true to f.ex. end a digest or wait step.
If leveraged, this could also lead to be used as schedules for checking workflows to be run. But this may be out of scope.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This would enable followup emails or even responses to interaction more smoothly and would reduce the developers need to setup complex cronjobs for this.

Use-Cases I can think of:
- Error was resolved
- Errors & Warnings Workflow detected an error with a high priority, so it will skip the current digest and will populate all current digest events and the current event
- Thanks for your reply f.ex. in discord => maybe such use-cases can get much more complex to be honest :)

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1. condition check function => the function which will check if a condition was met
2. ttl or trigger event-selector => define how often this should be triggered
3. BackOff strategy => to reduce systemload after a while

From @jainpawan21 : managing seen/unseen state of notifications was supported in the old @novu/notification-center but is no longer supported in the new @novu/react hooks and components. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I would love to use this feature to build a notification experience very similar to Facebook where the app badge count is set based on the seen/unseen counts and not the read/unread counts. Also I want to be able to mark all notifications as seen after the user opens the notification popup to clear the badge count but still keep the distinction of read/unread in the notification list.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

@novu/react components and hooks support setting seen/unseen states for all notifications and individual notifications, and hooks to fetch seen/unseen counts in the SDK and react hooks.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

After NextJS 15 the typing changed for Route Handlers. The second argument is now of type ""RouteContext"", which causes this error.

Inngest, another open source project with very similar structure to Novu, has resolved the issue for their product. The relevant source code from Inngest (and how they fixed the issue) can be found here: https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/blob/main/packages/inngest/src/next.ts

Using their source I was able to create a custom Novu serve() function and get this working, but it would be nice to have this out-of-the-box with Novu.

2628665969,6822,🚀 Feature: Customized Preference System exposed to bridge,"### 🔖 Feature description

With the new version v2 and the introduced bridge processing, novu could also introduce a custom preference system, where devs can define schemas for the preferences like the existing control/payload schema, which are then exposed to the customer and to the workflows as well.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Several different requests like customized digest for workflows are already requested and I think with this system, the chance to support more of them out of the box is even higher. 
When used with topics (#6789) the dev can define relations between topics and workflows much more specific

Use Cases I could think of:
- Customized digest
- Customized E-Mail behavior, f.ex. setting if email should include personal data or should be anonymized
- Define for each topic (f.ex. asset or post) which workflow (by preference system), should be used (like github customized notifications for each repo)

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1. Define Preference Schema at workflows / maybe also on topics (#6789)
2. pass them as variables to the workflow

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Example:
```
workflow(""xxx"", async ({ step, subscriber, preferences, topic }) => {

2627333772,6820,Clarity/notes regarding the project license,"Hello,

I'm interested in open source licensing and, after looking over the project, just wanted to raise and query a few things I noticed:

- The [License section of your readme](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/424b0fb7d8f870be81bc51171e036c488069b6d6/README.md?plain=1#L218-L220) makes no mention that other licenses are at play in the project, which could leave some users assuming the is MIT licensed alone.
- The [license badge](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/424b0fb7d8f870be81bc51171e036c488069b6d6/README.md?plain=1#L19-L21) in your readme is broken, likely because GitHub/Shields no longer sees the license file as a typical known/MIT license file.
- In regard to [the license file itself](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/424b0fb7d8f870be81bc51171e036c488069b6d6/LICENSE#L23-L24), it may be better to remove the ""MIT License"" header since it's no longer just MIT with that addition, and someone may just read that and assume standard MIT. Alternatively, the custom addition could be moved to the top.
- To understand the existing license terms following the license text, you have to scan the project for license files which is a bit of a pain, especially as there only seems to actually be a [single other license](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/424b0fb7d8f870be81bc51171e036c488069b6d6/apps/web/src/ee/LICENSE)? Might be a better just to directly reference that folder and license.
- [Based on a quick search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anovuhq%2Fnovu+%22%2Fee%2F%22+AND+NOT+path%3A%22%2Fee%2F%22&type=code) there seems to be a good few references on the `ee` code from the open code, indicating the `ee` code is relied upon to run/build the application. If so then users looking to use this as an open source project may be unknowingly using code under your  [""Novu Proprietary Software License""](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/424b0fb7d8f870be81bc51171e036c488069b6d6/apps/web/src/ee/LICENSE) and therefore unknowingly agreeing to the terms of that license.

2620388939,6789,🚀 Feature: Topic Processors,"### 🔖 Feature description

Novu topics could be extended with several new functionality to improve the targeted delivery audience by integrating custom processors into the @novu/framework package over the bridgeUrl with the user provided backend.
Some of the provided concept-ideas may also be aplicable to introduce in the ui as well.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Novu topics are by desing currently not secured, not strictly tied to a product database and sycing topics in advance is a huge task exspecialy for larger and existing systems, therefore this integration would help to fetch/validate data at runtime and only when its required. 
With such integration, users can also be more confident to use those topics, exspecialy for privacy related content and ensure the targeted users are the wanted ones.
This would also reduce complexity when using a microservice architecture. when querying subscribers beforehand.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I will explain some concepts, which may or may not make sense :)

Integrate the user provided backend with processors like when using workflows. Several different processors, which can be tied to a topic name.

*Processing Types:*
- *beforeTrigger*: this could be used to determine if additional users should be added to the topic
- *validateSubscribers*: this could be used to validate if the subscriber is still valid or if he/she has to be removed from the topic, could also be used to execute it in batch, if the subscribers are very many, when a subscriber is registering themselfs to the topic, this can be used as a validator
- *onAddSubscriber*: could be used to do additional things, after a subscriber is added
- *onRemoveSubscriber*: could be used to do additional things, after a subscriber is removed

*Topic Variables*: Defining a controll/payload schema could help to pass some some additional properties to the processors. f.ex. to determine which subscribers to fetch. As an alternative to variables the processors coul use wildcards. But for type saftly, i would suggest using a schema here.

*Timeouts/TTL*: Each Data returned by a processor should have a ttl, so in a production use-case the amount of executions is also limited/reduced.

*Invalidation*: With this aproach, existing processor data could be manualy invalidated to enforce a new run for the topic, when triggered next time. F.ex. someone is leaving an organization => invalidate all related topics.

*Subscription Status*: to overwrite some of the processors and remove the need to save additional data in the user-provided backend, subscriptions could have 3 status: 1. subscribed, 2. unsubscribed, 3. unknown => this would enable users to unsubscibe, even when the topicProcessor provides them => users could keep their custom preferences

*Preferences & Self-Service*: as mentioned within #6822 users can be enabled to define preferences and the validator function above can be used to determine, if they can self-register with the topic. This would enable frontend to register users to notifications, even if the topic has not been triggered/setup before.

*Example:*
```
topic(
    'organization',
{
   async beforeTrigger ({ payload, control }) => {
      // custom processors
      // return an object of subscribers
      return { subscribers: [] }
   },
   async validateSubscribers ({ payload, control, subscribers, isBatch }) => {
      // custom processors
      return { invalidSubscriberIds: [] };
   },
   async onAddSubscribers({ payload, control, subscribers, isBatch }) => {
      // custom processors
   },
   async onRemoveSubscribers({ payload, control, subscribers, isBatch }) => {
      // custom processors
   },
},
{
   payloadSchema: z.object({
      organizationId: z.string(),
      role: z.enum(['DEFAULT', 'ADMIN']).default('DEFAULT'),
   }),
   controlSchema: z.object({
      fetchType: z.enum([""DEFAULT"",""CUSTOM""]).default([""DEFAULT""]),
   }),
   ttl: 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
});

2615621300,6777,🐛 Bug Report: @novu/frameworks throws no reasonable error when having invalid configuration,"### 📜 Description

We had an error, which was releated, to an invalid configuration of our env variables: NOVU_API_URL and NOVU_SECRET_KEY.
We had used the @novu/node lib before and therefore had env in place which met the naming from this lib. (NOVU_BACKEND_URL/NOVU_API_KEY)

This resulted in a misconfiguration (our fault, we could have been reading better :) ) with a strange/wrong debugging experience.
We had to take a deep dive why the following error was present and we were not able to pin down the exact origin for a few hours.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Deploy self-hosted version
2. Deploy bridge server without proper env configuration

### 👍 Expected behavior

The system tried to reach the cloud url of novu instead of the self-hosted on, which is correct, but the error should represent, that the endpoint could not be reached with this configuration. like a 401 error or similar. The errors in the console of @novu/framework should also be more detailed.

Other suggestions: 
- we would also suggest to use a similar naming across libs for the same thing :)
- manualy configurable keys, without need to just use the env vars.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots
The error present at the ui was:
Workflow with id: order-recieved has an invalid state. Step with id: in-app has invalid result. Please provide the correct step result.
![Unbekannt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7656893-907d-4bb1-aa36-0b831c4c3e2c)
The console just shows, that the step could not be hydrated.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbafd520-ca63-4bb0-a771-776fd9bf9e2b)
The ui shows this weird error. We think this is due to the fact, that the step before could not be handled because of the misconfiguration.

2607638728,6750,🌟 Feedback Needed: Rebuilding the workflow editor experience,"## Context
Recently, we have re-built our content and workflow execution engine by introducing the new [Framework SDK](https://docs.novu.co/sdks/framework/typescript/overview),  the goal was to establish a flexible and customizable foundation so that simple use cases can be done with a GUI, and advanced use cases can be done from code with great Developer Experience.

Right, we are looking to redesign the dashboard interface for the workflow editor and other pages based on the learnings we have so far to provide an even better no-code experience while still allowing the rest to extend with framework-based workflow definitions and run-time.

## What's next?
The design and implementation of the new dashboard are currently in motion. We are trying to incorporate as much learning as we can into the new UX flow.

<img width=""1920"" alt=""Cover-dashboard"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1e40ca-0396-4cf6-9822-8d01d76a7e92"">

Also, we have partnered with Arik from [Maily](https://maily.to/) to create the best email editing experience that could've easily been extended with custom components and embed it into the new step editor experience. Check the [Live Maily Playground](https://maily.to/playground).

## How you can help?

As a comment to this issue, write any feedback you have with the current workflow management experience focusing on:
- No-Code and Code email editor experience
- Working with more complex content forms (Digest, etc..)
- Overall UX challenges you are facing with the existing design

2606701544,6747,🐛 Bug Report: Docker Image v2.0.0 Environment Variables Not Applied to Frontend URLs,"### 📜 Description

The web container in the self-hosted Docker setup doesn't properly apply the environment variables to the frontend application URLs. When changing environment variables like `REACT_APP_API_URL` or `REACT_APP_WS_URL`, the frontend application continues to use the default/build-time URLs (e.g localhost:3000 for API) instead of the runtime environment variables.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Use the official docker-compose.yml file for Novu v2.0.0
2. Set custom environment variables for the web container:

```yaml
web:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_API_URL: ""http://custom-domain.com:3000""
      REACT_APP_WS_URL: ""http://custom-domain.com:3002""
```

3. Run docker-compose up -d
4. Access the web interface at localhost:4200
5. Open browser developer tools and inspect network requests
6. Observe that API and WebSocket requests are still being made to the default URLs instead of the custom domain

### 👍 Expected behavior

The web container should use the provided environment variables for API and WebSocket URLs, allowing proper configuration for custom domains and different deployment scenarios.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The web container ignores the environment variables and continues to use the default URLs hardcoded during the image build. Network requests in browser developer tools show connections being attempted to default URLs instead of the configured custom domain.

NestJs and multiple other services are using this lib already for validation and it would help quite alot to just reuse existing classes within the workflow definitions.

2573253941,6653,🐛 Bug Report: Failed to add first workflow in self-hosted mode,"### 📜 Description

I tried following steps on https://docs.novu.co/community/self-hosting-novu/deploy-with-docker
I cannot add my first workflow, the badge at the top says ""You are currently viewing demo workflows. Add your own by completing the setup."".

But I cannot finish the setup because using `npx novu@latest init --secret-key=308286b40fd880b9a7c1771f0a72dfeb` (it's taken from dashboard) failed with `Failed to verify your secret key against https://api.novu.co. For EU instances use --api-url https://eu.novu.co or provide the correct secret key`.

I tried running Local Studio with `npx novu@latest dev --port 4000` which ends with never finding 'Bridge Endpoint scan'. I found out that I need to use command `npx novu@latest dev -o https://deploy-preview-8--onboarding-sandbox.netlify.app` which finds endpoint, but LocalStudio shows black template screen and gives lots of errors in JS console.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Run steps
```
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/novuhq/novu

# Go to the docker community folder
cd novu/docker/community

# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Start Novu
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
2. Go to http://localhost:4200/
3. Signup
4. Open ""getting started""
5. Execute command from ""Initialize a new project"" section

### 👍 Expected behavior

LocalStudio should show workflows (I guess)

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

2566640970,6631,🐛 Bug Report: @novu/js - Updating the read state of a Notification results in an empty instance,"### 📜 Description

Hello,

With an `InApp` notification created with the `data` (https://docs.novu.co/sdks/framework/typescript/steps/inbox) key inside, updating the read state (using `notification.read()` or `notification.unread()`) results to an empty Notification instance.


### 👟 Reproduction steps

Front-end reproduction (with samples Workflows to reproduce the issue): https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb1-gov1vt?file=main.js

```js
// taken from the Stackblitz repro for quick review
import { Novu } from '@novu/js';

const novu = new Novu({
  subscriberId: import.meta.env.VITE_NOVU_SUB_ID,
  applicationIdentifier: import.meta.env.VITE_NOVU_APP_ID,
  backendUrl: 'https://api.novu.co',
  socketUrl: 'https://ws.novu.co',
});

const notifications = await novu.notifications.list();
const [notificationToUpdate] = notifications.data.notifications ?? [];
const updatedNotification = await notificationToUpdate.read();

console.log('updatedNotification', updatedNotification);
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

This is a valid Notification instance with data inside:

<img width=""531"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c77a8e1-3599-45ee-af85-9f3192b53959"">


### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

This is bad Notification instance with no data inside:

<img width=""722"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88326583-e06d-4bd6-a064-fca437db077a"">

### Novu version

NA

### node version

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

The Novu API response when calling `https://api.novu.co/v1/inbox/notifications/<NOTIFICATION_ID>/read` returns the following payload:

<img width=""562"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464885cc-ade5-46e0-9bff-23ef975fd02a"">

No `data` key exists and I think this is the root cause. The `@novu/client` reads the `.data` key from `response.json()` to create a Notification which overlaps with `Notification.data` definition (https://docs.novu.co/sdks/framework/typescript/steps/inbox):

2564059770,6611,🚀 Feature: Add return types to @novu/node,"### 🔖 Feature description

It seems like @novu/node returns `AxiosResponse<any, any>` for all of the network requests. [Subscriber.ts](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/packages/node/src/lib/subscribers/subscribers.ts)

Can we get it to be with proper return types?

Your api is well documented https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/subscribers/get-subscriber.


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I need proper types when developing or else everything goes to hell. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

You should be able to return codegen to generate all of the response types and the methods as well

I've used hay-api before, and its really simple: https://heyapi.vercel.app/openapi-ts/get-started.html
Just hook this script into your build process, it will generate a `services.gen.ts` with proper types. It'll generate the .ts. api based your openapi schema. Call those functions instead of axios directly.  

```
import { defineConfig } from '@hey-api/openapi-ts';

export default defineConfig({
  client: '@hey-api/client-fetch',
  input: 'path/to/openapi.json',
  output: 'libs/node/src/generated',
});

2547559794,6572,🐛 Bug Report: Triggering an event for multiple receivers fails when one of them is invalid,"### 📜 Description
**Update**: I've posted an updated and more precise description of the error in a comment [below](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/6572#issuecomment-2396755352).

**Old description**:
I trigger an event with this payload:
```json
{
    ""actor"": ""myTestActor"",
    ""name"": ""generic-message"",
    ""payload"": {
        ""myTestData"": ""hello""
    },
    ""to"": [
        {
            ""type"": ""Topic"",
            ""topicKey"": ""myTopic""
        },
        {
            ""type"": ""Subscriber"",
            ""subscriberId"": ""mySubscriber""
        }
    ],
}
```
`mySubscriber` will get a notification, subscribers to `myTopic` won't. Removing the second `to` entry won't help - the topic won't receive the event as long as `to` has the form of a list.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create a topic named `myExistingTopic` and subscribe with a user to it.
2. Run
```sh
curl --location 'https://api.notification.app.myCompany.cloud/v1/events/trigger' \
--header 'Authorization: ApiKey *******' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    ""actor"": ""myTestActor"",
    ""name"": ""generic-message"",
    ""payload"": {
        ""myTestData"": ""hello""
    },
     ""to"": [
        {
            ""type"": ""Topic"",
            ""topicKey"": ""myTopic""
        },
        {
            ""type"": ""Subscriber"",
            ""subscriberId"": ""mySubscriber""
        }
    ],
}'
```
The response is `201` with
```json
{
    ""data"": {
        ""acknowledged"": true,
        ""status"": ""processed"",
        ""transactionId"": ""487f708e-4a37-4438-9ec8-87deb5510ee2""
    }
}
```
3. See that the subscribers for `myTopic` didn't receive any messge, while the subscriber did. Furthermore, in the Novu Center's Activity Feed you won't see anything about `myTopic`.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The users subscribed to `myTopic` should receive a message about the triggered event.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The users subscribed to `myTopic` doesn't receive a message about the triggered event.

### Novu version

0.24.0

### npm version

I cannot provide this information right now, but we're basically using ghcr.io/novuhq/novu/api:0.24.0

### node version

20.11.1

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

It seems like triggering an event for a topic works when it's not in an array. So
```json
{
    ...
    ""to"": {
        ""type"": ""Topic"",
        ""topicKey"": ""myTopic""
    }
}
```
will work.

### Kind of issue

Missing information

### Issue description

NestJs is like a superset of express, therefore a user can leverage the middleware implementation similar to express.

Afterwards you find some of our implemented code to use for your documentation:

## the express middleware, using require, because we are using commonjs
``` novu.middleware.ts

import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { serve } from '@novu/framework/dist/servers/express';
import workflows from './workflows';

@Injectable()
export class NovuMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
    use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
        // Using require instead of import syntax, because novu export is not commonjs
        require(""@novu/framework/express"").serve({
            workflows,
        } as Parameters<typeof serve>['0'])(req, res, next)
    }
}
```

## Probably the right implementation
``` novu.middleware.ts

import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { serve } from '@novu/framework/express';
import workflows from './workflows';

@Injectable()
export class NovuMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
    use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
        serve({
            workflows,
        })(req, res, next)
    }
}
```

## app.module.ts
``` app.module.ts

import { MiddlewareConsumer, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { NovuMiddleware } from './shared/novu/novu.middleware';

@Module({

Outputs can get quite long and exspecial within production this can produce unwanted console logging garbage, so we would like to have an option to hide this output. f.ex. based on NODE_ENV.

```


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. invoke subscriber updatePreferences api to set email and push channel to false for subscriber for a workflow.
2. invoke novu.trigger function to trigger the above workflow and subscriber;

### 👍 Expected behavior

 Since the subscriber's preferences indicate they should not receive email and push notifications, triggering the workflow should not result in any notifications being sent to them.


### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

When I trigger workflow 66ecdd18a17d00ef6f792cab for this subscriber, I still receive both email and push notifications, contrary to my expectation.

2516104670,6470,🐛 Bug Report: Digest not merging email (or probably not working on docker self hosted),"### 📜 Description

Hi Team,

I wanted to bring to your attention a persistent issue with the email digest functionality, specifically its failure to merge consecutive emails within the designated timeframe.

I've reviewed existing reports, including the one found here:
[Issue Link](https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1192190197547401276)
, and I can consistently reproduce this bug using Docker Compose in versions 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, and the latest production tag. This issue appears to occur in both event and scheduled scenarios, suggesting that it may have been a long-standing problem or that I might be overlooking something.

For your reference, here is an example workflow used for testing the issue: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55644cae-3d8b-47a1-8b88-57280d36e7a9)




### 👟 Reproduction steps


### Workflow Creation and Notification Process

**1. Create a Workflow:**
   - Follow the structure provided in the example workflow below:
   ![Workflow Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55644cae-3d8b-47a1-8b88-57280d36e7a9)

**2. Develop HTML Templates:**
   - Create a set of HTML templates with varying content. For example:
   ```html
   <p>Welcome to our service!</p>
   <p>Don't miss our latest updates!</p>
   ```

**3. Define Simple HTML Custom Code Templates:**
   - Use JavaScript to define simple HTML templates as follows:
   ```js
   const template1 = '<p>Your account is set up successfully!</p>';
   const template2 = '<p>Your subscription will expire soon, please renew!</p>';
   ```

**4. Send Notifications Using the Novu Node SDK:**
   - Implement the following POST request for each template using the Novu Node SDK:
   ```js
   // Sending notification for template1
   await novu.trigger(notificationWorkflowId, {
     to: {
       subscriberId: userId,
       email: 'you@gmail.com'
     },
     payload: { html: template1 },
     overrides: {
       email: {
         subject: 'Your account setup is complete!',
       },
     }
   });

   // Sending notification for template2
   await novu.trigger(notificationWorkflowId, {
     to: {
       subscriberId: userId,
       email: 'you@gmail.com'
     },
     payload: { html: template2 },
     overrides: {
       email: {
         subject: 'Important: Renew your subscription!',
       },
     }
   });
   ```



### 👍 Expected behavior

The digest should consolidate all email content into a single email message.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

In digest mode, only the initial email will be sent, disregarding any subsequent messages in the digest timeframe.

2508561791,6449,🐛 Bug Report: API request content-length is limit to 100KB,"### 📜 Description

Right now, Novu API can only accept request size 100 KB at most. A simple trigger event is around 70 KB, but with `attachments`, it can easily exceed 100 KB, leading to code 413 Payload too large.

Not a NestJS expert, but I think the code below does not initialize Nest App with correct `bodyParser` and `rawBody` configuration, leading to an unexpected behavior.

https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/0269ddc5e1ca905adf76d1014e583de1a8c21672/apps/api/src/bootstrap.ts#L63

Quick NestJS reference: https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/raw-body#body-parser-size-limit



### 👟 Reproduction steps

Use a simple trigger event with attachments.

```ts
await novu.trigger(""workflow-id"", {
  to: ""subscriber-id"",
  payload: {
    // Practically total file size is limit around 30 KB, because the request itself is around 70 KB.
    attachments: [bufferData] 
  }
}) 
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

There are 2 possible ways.

1. Allow a safe, fixed limit for an API request size.
2. Expose a configuration (e.g., via environment variable), so developers can customize limits on their own. Why? Each notification/message provider has their own size limit, so developers can set the limit at their own judgment. For example, Gmail is capped at 25 MB per request.

I work on a React/Typescript app and i'm currently implementing a custom notification interface based on all the hooks available through the package (@novu/notification-center).

I'm facing an error using the following hook : ""useUpdateUserGlobalPreferences"" and more precisely the ""updateUserGlobalPreferences"" method available throught this hook

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Setup a React environment

2. Install @novu/notification-center package (2.0.0-canary.0)

3. Create a component using the hook ""useUpdateUserGlobalPreferences"", for example : 
```
import { ReactElement, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFetchUserGlobalPreferences, useUpdateUserGlobalPreferences } from '@novu/notification-center';

function UserNotificationsSettingsForm(): ReactElement {
  const { refetch, data } = useFetchUserGlobalPreferences();
  const { updateUserGlobalPreferences } = useUpdateUserGlobalPreferences();

  useEffect(() => {
    refetch();
  }, []);

  const handleUpdateUserGlobalPreferences = () => {
    updateUserGlobalPreferences({
      preferences: [
        {
          channelType: 'email',
          enabled: false,

        Update Preferences
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserNotificationsSettingsForm;
```

5. Call the ""updateUserGlobalPreferences"" method (in the example, with a simple button click)

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should update user global preferences and return success (or nothing)

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It actually encounter an error in the ""useUpdateUserGlobalPreferences.js"" file as mentionned in this error message : 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/648a2e11-fc76-4991-a14d-7bd8db1ba1c7)

It seems that the function tries to reach a key in the ""object"" named ""old"" but this is impossible because of the type of ""old"" wich seems to be an array :

2455566182,6285,🚀 Feature: Add Content-Available Option for Push Notification Workflow Step,"### 🔖 Feature description

Add an option to set content-available flag for push notifications in the workflow step, specifically for iOS devices. This feature would allow specifying that the notification should cause the iOS app to start in the background to run a background task.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This feature is crucial for iOS apps that need to perform background tasks upon receiving a push notification. It allows for more efficient handling of notifications and enables developers to implement features like:

- Pre-fetching content before the user opens the app
- Updating app content in the background
- Performing time-sensitive tasks without user interaction

By implementing this feature, Novu would provide more flexibility and power to developers using the platform for push notifications, especially those targeting iOS devices.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Add a new boolean option in the push notification workflow step configuration, such as contentAvailable.
When set to true, include the content-available flag in the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) or Expo Push Notification Service payload.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

This feature is specifically related to Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and is similar to the Expo property _contentAvailable. It's important to note that this feature only applies to iOS devices and will have no effect on Android or web push notifications.

Allowing the use of templates in Mailgun [README](https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun.js?tab=readme-ov-file#templates)

Majority of mail providers has this feature and should be allowed to set similar to as you have capability for [Mailsend ](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/email/mailersend#using-mailersend-template)

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently there is no way to send in your own custom data parameters to the request as all props are manually set. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Option 1: Add the option similar as you have with Mailsend
Option 2: Utilize spread operator and allow for ""customData"" be whatever you pass into message create

Can't only allow for setting the template ID we also need the ability to pass variables data

At the current stage, although you can add multiple provider integrations, you can only use the primary selected one

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

One use of this would be for apps working in multiple regions, and wanting to use a different sms provider for each for cost efficiency reasons. With this feature, a different sms provider should be able to be picked for each workflow

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

This feature should enable workflows to pick their providers, or even let each step have a seperate provider for usage of cases of error handling https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/6092, e.g. when one provider is down

2375903645,5840,🐛 Bug Report: Class constructor EventEmitter cannot be invoked without 'new',"### 📜 Description

Hi. I recently deployed my nuxt app to Cloudflare and I get this error every time I try to register a new subscriber.
`Class constructor EventEmitter cannot be invoked without 'new'`

Here's my function code
```ts
export const registerSubscriber = async (subscriber: User) => {
  const [firstName, lastName] = subscriber.name.split("" "");

    firstName,
    lastName,
    email: subscriber.email,
    ...(subscriber.picture && { avatar: subscriber.picture }),
  });
};
```

Probably has something to do with Cloudflare?

### 👟 Reproduction steps

- Create an app with nuxtHub.
- Add novu/node.
- Write util function to register subscribers.
- Call earlier created function in server route.

   - [ ] bug report

   - [x] question about how to use this project

- **Summary**
I'm trying to fetch all notifications and only unread notifications separately. 
I'm doing something like
```javascript
const {
    data: unreadData,
    isLoading: isUnreadLoading,
    hasNextPage: hasUnreadNextPage,
    fetchNextPage: fetchUnreadNextPage,
  } = useFetchNotifications(
    {
      query: {
        limit: 10,
        read: false,
      },
    },
    {
      refetchOnMount: true,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
      onError: (err) => handleError(err),
    }
  );

  const {
    data: allData,
    isLoading: isAllLoading,
    hasNextPage: hasAllNextPage,
    fetchNextPage: fetchAllNextPage,
  } = useFetchNotifications(
    { query: { limit: 10 } },
    {
      refetchOnMount: true,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
      onError: (err) => handleError(err),
    }
  );
```
I believe `useInfiniteQuery` underneath `useFetchNotifications` is using `infinite_notifications`  as `queryKey`  for both requests. Hence, returning the same cached notifications. I was wondering if there's a way to modify the `queryKey` for each request to fetch all notifications and unread notifications in separate requests.

Thanks!

It would be nice to have a function that will be triggered when new notification/notifications arrive to add some custom logic to pre-process the notifications before showing them on UI. For example to change the order of notifications or filter out old notifications etc.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This function will allow adding some custom logic to pre-process notifications. For example, re-order the notification to implement priority of messages or filter out old notifications etc,

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

So the function should be invoked when new notifications are made, but before rendering notifications on UI to pre-process all notifications.
Input parameter is all received notifications and the function returns notifications that should be shown on the UI

add a tenant_id header to api calls. when this header is present, no tenant data is allowed in the body and everything gets mapped to the specific tenant.

2344559660,5703,🐛 Bug Report: Inconsistent Documentation Regarding APNs Overrides in ITriggerOverrideFCM,"### 📜 Description


The documentation for the `overrides` field in the Novu SDK [([link to Novu SDK documentation on FCM triggers])](https://docs.novu.co/channels-and-providers/push/fcm#sdk-trigger-example) suggests that it supports overriding properties for APNs (Apple Push Notification service). However, attempts to use the `apns` property within the `overrides` field result in a TypeScript error:

```typescript
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'apns' does not exist in type 'ITriggerOverrideFCM'.ts
```

Investigation reveals that the codebase for `ITriggerOverrideFCM` does not currently include an `apns` property definition.


### 👟 Reproduction steps

```typescript
import { Novu } from ""@novu/node"";

const novu = new Novu(""<NOVU_API_KEY>"");

novu.trigger(""<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>"", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: ""<SUBSCRIBER_ID>"",
  },
  payload: {
    abc: ""def"", // If the notification is a data notification, the payload will be sent as the data
  },
  overrides: {
    fcm: {
      // type: 'data' => will turn this into an FCM data notification, where the payload is sent as a data notification. If the type is not set, you can use the ""data"" override to send notification messages with optional data payload
      type: ""data"",

      // URL of an image to be displayed in the notification.
      imageUrl: ""https://domain.com/image.png"",

      // If type is not set, you can use the ""data"" override to send notification messages with optional data payload
      data: {
        key: ""value"",
      },

      // Check FCM Overrides section above for these types
      apns: {}
    },
  },
});


``` 
### 👍 Expected behavior

Based on the Novu SDK documentation for ITriggerOverrideFCM and the overrides field (specifically the mention of APNs support), I expected the following:

- The overrides field would accept an object literal containing properties for overriding various trigger configurations.
- One of the supported properties within the overrides object literal would be apns.
- Using the apns property would allow me to specify modifications for the APNs portion of the trigger configuration. This might involve overriding properties like notification content, sound, badge count, etc., specifically for APNs devices.

By following these expectations, I would have been able to configure APNs overrides for FCM triggers within my application using the Novu SDK.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots


When attempting to use the `apns` property within the `overrides` field of the `ITriggerOverrideFCM` type, the following behavior occurred:

* **TypeScript error**: The TypeScript compiler throws an error stating:

```typescript
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'apns' does not exist in type 'ITriggerOverrideFCM'.ts
```

This error indicates that the `ITriggerOverrideFCM` type definition does not recognize `apns` as a valid property within the `overrides` object literal.

* **No APNs overrides possible:** Due to the error, you cannot configure any overrides specific to APNs notifications when using the `ITriggerOverrideFCM` type.

2338628252,5689,🐛 Bug Report: Missing additional fields in Custom SMTP provider,"### 📜 Description

I have a need to set some of the more advanced properties when sending emails using the Custom SMTP provider (nodemailer).

In particular, I need to add custom headers and also to control the envelope sender/from address to ensure proper bounce/reply-to handling.

For example, I need to be able to do this (sample event trigger payload):

```
{
   ""name"": ""email-workflow"",
    ""to"": {
         ""subscriberId"": ""1234"",
         ""firstName"": ""User"",
         ""lastName"": ""One"",
         ""email"": ""user1@example.com""
    },
   ""payload"": {
       ""email_body"": ""<b>This is the body of the email</b>"",
       ""email_subject"": ""This is a test""
    },
    ""overrides"": {
       ""email"": {
         ""headers"": {    <---- NEW
            ""X-Custom-Header"": ""123456789""
         },
         ""envelope"": {  <--- NEW
               ""from"": ""bounces+user1=example.com@mycorp.com
         },
         ""senderName"": ""Sender User"",
         ""replyTo"": ""director1@example.com"",  
         ""html"": ""<h1>This should be the HTML part of the email</h1>"",
         ""text"": ""This should be in plain text in the email"",
         ""layoutIdentifier"": ""empty""
     }
  }
}
```

Looking through the code (`packages/providers/src/lib/nodemailer/nodemailer.provider.ts`) , it appears that this is already partially handled as the `IEmailOptions` interface has support for `replyTo` and `headers`.  It just needs to be passed through to the nodemailer in the Custom STMP provider.

It appears that the headers are already handled in other providers, eg: sendgrid, so it should be a simple copy/paste from there, I think, like:


```
private createMailData(options: IEmailOptions): SendMailOptions {
    const sendMailOptions: SendMailOptions = {
....
      to: options.to,
      subject: options.subject,
      headers: options.headers    <-- new
      envelope: options.envelope <-- new
    };

    if (options.replyTo) {
      sendMailOptions.replyTo = options.replyTo;
    }

    return sendMailOptions;
  }

```

Adding support for the envelope options would require extending IEmailOptions with additional fields, similar to the header using something like `envelope?: Record<string, string>;`.

nodemailer supports envelope options here: https://nodemailer.com/message/#routing-options and https://nodemailer.com/smtp/envelope/

Custom fields/headers should be passed through to the SMTP server

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Related page

https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/events/trigger-event

### Kind of issue

Unclear explanations

### Issue description

I think the documentation about the `""to""` has two issues:
- It doesn't really tell that lists are allowed since to types are ""just"" `object` or `string`, but not `object[]` and `string`
- It is faulty about how to specify subscribers with type 3, where it claims to require a `""topicKey""` 
![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/10669876/d2f8922f-7d9e-4605-adb7-4b124af1ee10)
Instead it must be `""subscriberId""`
For example, in my case the correct usage would be:
```json
{
...
  ""to"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""Topic"",
      ""topicKey"": ""my_topic""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""Subscriber"",
      ""subscriberId"": ""my_id""
    }
  ]
...
}
```
But by folllowing the documentation, I'ld neither know that I can apply a list here, nor that I must pass `""subscriberId"": ""my_id""` instead of `""topicKey"": ""my_id""`.

This does not look such a big deal, but certainly, the app routing stopped working when integrating Novu. The URL changes parameters/slug when some routed button/anchor tag is triggered, but the page don't render new views. It might be related with the error logged. 

I've also installed @types/react as suggested by the Docs (btw some lib types are not synhcronized with last versions of this package, so had to downgrade @types/react), it made no difference.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Just follow same steps from https://docs.novu.co/quickstarts/angular
2. Make sure to use last version of Angular (v.17)

### 👍 Expected behavior

Just not throwing this React related error and allowing the app to work as expected (standard routing between components on click routed elements -currently blocked-).

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Logged error:
<img width=""1319"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-05-16 at 18 50 56"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/angular-quickstart/assets/59086203/13a41278-ed91-4ae2-bd69-0f4920d878fa"">

And app internal routing completely blocked.

2292971261,5556,New organization onboarding through api (Getting api key of newly created organization),"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently novu provides api for create organization, get environments , get api keys etc, but it provides all the info related to current organization.
https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/organizations/create-organization
https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/environments/get-api-keys
How we can get api key for new organization created through api instead of copy it from UI, create organization api wont be useful unless respective api key available through api which still create dependency of UI. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Automation of onbaording of new organization through code instead of manual process using UI and copying api key. which enhance the purpose of usage of apis.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Return api key after creating new organization, or get api key of other organization if current api key has access to.


### 🔄️ Additional Information

I believe If you allowing to create organization, allowing to make changes to that organization is basic need.

2291261931,5548,🐛 Bug Report: step conditions not working with push webhook provider,"### 📜 Description

Novu supports adding multiple integrations of same provider. Each integration can have step conditions on `tenants` and based on these conditions, these providers can be used in workflow execution.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create two push webhook integrations, give different webhook URL and secret hmac key. Give different names to each one to make it easy to identify later. Make these two integrations active
2. Create a subscriber `push-webhook-subscriber` for testing this bug
3. Update the above subscriber's credentials using [this](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) API for both of the integrations. Use any string value for device token
4. Create a workflow with only push step. write title and message content. 
5. make sure only above two push webhook integrations are active for push channel providers
6. Create two tenants with different name and identifier. Store this data
```
// for first tenant
{
  ""country"": ""US""
}

// for second tenant
{
  ""country"": ""EU""
}
```

7. Add conditions on tenants for data.country key on both integrations

8. Trigger the workflow to `push-webhook-subscriber` subscriber and send tenant identifier also
9. Push step will be executed for both providers and conditions will not take effect

### 👍 Expected behavior

tenants conditions should take effect and integration should be disabled based on conditions

2250037072,5430,🚀 Feature: Slack personal multi channel support,"### 🔖 Feature description

Slackbot integrations can be done in two ways: Websockets and channel permissions. Websockets only allow one channel to be added at a time. But this doesn't work when a message needs to be send to a specific user. 
This feature should allow Novu to send a notification to a personal channel in slack, using either the channelID, or the subscribers email.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Our system will send notifications to users who have a guest at the front of an office. They need to be send a personal message on slack. We want to use Novu because the system should be able to be hosted on location for security reasons. 
We will know the emails of all users, but not automatically their slack personal ID, therefore we need to be able to reach their personal channel via email.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The slack API has two endpoints that are relevant for this issue, the postmessage endpoint and the endpoint for getting a user by email. When only a email is given, the integration should first get the id of the user, then afterwards it should use that ID in the post message endpoint to actually send the message. The should be a new integration.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

We've tried implementing this ourselves first, but got stuck on the integration structure, this integration needs information that the websocket type doesn't give. We've also tried other services and found that [Knock](https://docs.knock.app/integrations/chat/slack/overview) and [courier](https://www.courier.com/docs/platform/channels/direct-message/slack/) both support this type of advanced slack integration

2243389113,5409,🐛 Bug Report: Novu Headless Unit Testing Angular,"### 📜 Description

We have configured Novu headless mode and initialized headless service in an Angular component as follows:

`export class NotificationDialogComponent implements OnInit {
  headlessService: any;
  constructor(private authService: AuthService {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.authService
      .loadUserProfile()
      .then(() => {
        this.headlessService = new HeadlessService({
          applicationIdentifier: environment.novuConfig.applicationIdentifier,
          subscriberId: this.email,
          backendUrl: environment.novuConfig.backendUrl,
          socketUrl: environment.novuConfig.socketUrl,
        });
        this.initSession();
      })
      .catch();
  }

  initSession() {
    this.headlessService.initializeSession({
      listener: (res: FetchResult<ISession>) => {
        console.log('welcome to novu headless service', res);
      },
      onSuccess: (session: ISession) => {
        console.log(session, 'Success');
      },
      onError(error: any) {
        console.log(error, 'ERROR');
      },
    });
  }
}`

It is working fine however, we are unable to unit test this code as we are not able to mock the headless service. Since a new instance of the headless service is created in ngOnInit we are not able to mock it. Is it possible to inject the headless service in the component so that we can provide a mock implementation in the unit tests?

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. create a component in angular and import novu headless and its functions like initializeSession, fetchNotifications, listenNotificationRead, etc.
2. write unit test cases for the component in spec.ts file

### 👍 Expected behavior

it should successfully run all the unit test cases without any failures/errors.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Not able to mock the headless service. Since a new instance of the headless service is created in ngOnInit we are not able to mock it. Is it possible to inject the headless service in the component so that we can provide a mock implementation in the unit tests?

2239848927,5402,🚀 Feature: Support SendGrid ASM parameters,"### 🔖 Feature description

[ASM groups ](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/unsubscribe-groups)are a SendGrid feature designed to allow e-mail suppressions short of stopping all mail. 

The [SendGrid API ](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send) supports `asm` as an option, where the group id is matched against the recipient to see whether they should be sent mail or not.

Currently the Novu SendGrid provider doesn't support `asm` parameters passed via `customData`. This patches that to allow an asm group id to be passed directly through to SendGrid

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We have a use case where an ASM group is shared with other parts of our platform that require to send mail, so we need to suppress mail being sent to members of that group.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I will change the SendGrid provider to allow the passing of this option

2231092978,5380,🐛 Bug Report: Duplicate Notification,"### 📜 Description

Shows 1 extra notification in Inapp irrespective of the actual count. For example, if the actual Inapp notification count is 350, then it's showing as 350 as one feed and 1 count as separate feed in the notification as shown in below image. i've used Digest for InApp.
FYI: I checked the database count as well and it's showing 350.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Use Digest for Inapp
2. Bombard with more messages. for e.g: 300 & above

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should show exact count as 350 and avoid showing that extra 1 count as shown in below image.

FYI: Sometimes, it's showing count correctly.

2. Promote to Prod
3. Upgrade to version 24
5. Look back at the workflow in the UI in prod mode.
6. You should see the error on the UI similar to the one attached in the description

2208357754,5339,🚀 Feature: Custom Notification Center UI using Angular,"### 🔖 Feature description

I have a custom notification center UI built in Angular which I wanted to use instead of Novu's pre-built notification center UI while using Novu's backend.  I couldnt find any references in Novu's documentation which would help me achieve this in angular. The closest reference I found was using Novu angular styles to customise the UI. Is there any way I could use my custom notification center UI using Angular.

Thanks for the help. #

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I have a custom notification center UI built in Angular which I wanted to use instead of Novu's pre-built notification center UI while using Novu's backend.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I want to use my own HTML and CSS while Novu can provide necessary snippets in Angular TS to help me achieve the above.

### Issue description

I was looking for health check endpoint and it appears it is not documented in the API reference (Swagger) and docs.

2186982375,5304,🐛 Bug Report: The applicatiton restarting every 19 minutes,"### 📜 Description

The application is unexpectedly restarting every 19 minutes when hosted on Kubernetes. This behavior does not appear to be related to healthcheck, livenessProbe, or any similar Kubernetes configurations. It is suspected that there might be a connection with external integrations such as New Relic or Redis, however, these are encapsulated by the framework in use, which makes direct investigation of the issue challenging.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Host the application on Kubernetes using Novu version 0.22.
2. Observe the application's behavior over time, without specific interactions to trigger the problem.
3. Notice that the application restarts every 20 minutes without any apparent intervention or errors.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The application is expected to run continuously without unexpected restarts unless explicitly restarted by deployment operations or updates.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The application restarts every 19 minutes

Novu is a great system for centralized notification and messaging all in one place.

We are interested in extending our platform to support more types of channels that allow users to do what they need.

We are looking to add a new channel to support data integrations to allow data of the Notification to be streamed to some other system through a queuing system. This would allow users to create there own processing engine or ingest the events into a identity platform for there system.

A list of systems would be:
1. amqp
2. mqtt
3. Webhook
4. Kafka
5. Pulsar
6. Prometheus

This data provider would just send the full event data of the trigger to some other platform.

NOTE: this is not a feature for advanced integrations, this feature is solely so we can support users doing other things with Novu. The Novu team may choose to create more in-depth integrations in the future that are not covered by the basic data sent here. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This feature would allow users to send data to other internal systems for integration or coloration within there system.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

We plan to create a new channel and add providers like we do for any other provider.

2143787120,5215,🐛 Bug Report: HeadlessService.fetchNotifications returns different totalCount than expected,"### 📜 Description

I believe the `HeadlessService.fetchNotifications` returns as `totalCount`the number of elements fetched and not the number of total elements.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Fetch notifications with the `HeadlessService.fetchNotifications` method, and pass a query limit of 1 -> `totalCount`= 1
2. 1. Fetch notifications with the `HeadlessService.fetchNotifications` method, and pass a different query limit -> `totalCount`is different (number of data returned)

2143482656,5214,✨ Polishing: avoid react and react dom as dependencies for notification-center-vue,"### 📜 Description

When pulling `notification-center-vue` in a Vue/Nuxt project, the `react` and `react-dom` dependencies should be ""devDependencies"". `notification-center` seems to only have `react` and `react-dom` as `devDependencies` as well. 

This also conflicts with other potential third-party packages that have `react` as a peer dependency (like `@vercel/analytics`, forcing the use of `--legacy-peer-deps` flag or the `overrides` property in `package.json`. 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

- Install `notification-center-vue` in any vue project with `@vercel/analytics`
- Notice the mismatch in version

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should not have `react` and `react-dom` listed as dependencies, but maybe devDependencies or peerDepencencies instead.

The bug occures only when using SSR because of the line in `customElements.define('notification-center-web-component', NotificationCenterWebComponent);` 

SSR does not know a ""window""-Instance and thus also does not know `customElements`. A solution would be to check whether it's an SSR and only register then. It seems also to be only related with Angular 17 apps, it worked in earlier versions where there was not Vite and esbuild in use.

2122005915,5163,🐛 Bug Report & fix: subscriber details not available for digest filters,"### 📜 Description

If you use `on: 'subscriber'` for a filter on a digest step, that filter always fails because a bug causes all subscriber details to be null when evaluating filters on digests. I've figured out the root cause (a weirdness in ConditionsFilter's `normalizeVariablesData` that requires an optional argument on ConditionsFilterCommand to work correctly. We might want to fix that separately) and am ready to submit a PR once this issue is assigned to me.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Add a workflow with a digest with the following filter:
```
{
  ""value"": ""AND"",
  ""children"": [
    {
      ""field"": ""data.digest"",
      ""value"": ""digest"",
      ""operator"": ""EQUAL"",
      ""on"": ""subscriber""
    }
  ]
}
```

Trigger the workflow with a user that has the correct data:
```js
await novu.subscribers.identify(""subscriberId"", {
  firstName: ""Pawan"",
  lastName: ""Jain"",
  email: ""pawan.jain@domain.com"",
  data: { digest: ""digest"" }
});
await novu.trigger('workflow-id',
  {
    to: ['subscriberId'],

);
await novu.trigger('workflow-id',
  {
    to: ['subscriberId'],
    payload: { example: 'example' },
  }
);
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

The digesting should happen, as the susbcriber has the correct data for the filter to pass.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The subscriber receives two notifications, each digest saying in the web interface ""Step was filtered based on steps filters""

2106231711,5130,🐛 Bug Report: updating notification center encryption not available at Nodejs SDK,"### 📜 Description

Breaking change at environments API from 0.15.0 to 0.22.0. Updating encryption through the API no longer exists or is referenced in the changelog

```typescript
// Desired status is whatever we want and in my use case, comes from ENV
const desiredStatus = true
const response = await this.novu.environments.updateWidget({ notificationCenterEncryption: desiredStatus })
```

As you can see the API above is valid at `0.15.0` and the use case is to sync any instance running with the provided config to my custom Nestjs wrapper around Novu (this wrapper syncs configurations that come from env/dynamic with the running tenant and encryption is one of the properties)

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Install the latest version or starting from ``
2. Observe that `environments` no longer exposes a way to update a widget or encryption status at all expose

### 👍 Expected behavior

A method that is exposed through the SDK in order to facilitate encryption toggling

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

No longer exists, might have been changed and there might be another way of doing but it wasn't listed/referencedIt no

2103039393,5122,🚀 Feature: Brevo Email Templates,"### 🔖 Feature description

Add support for Brevo email templates (and template variables)

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently, Novu does not support email templates for Brevo.
The Brevo template engine allows, for example, to create fairly advanced conditions based on one or more variables (display conditions, loops, etc.).

I personally use Brevo in my company, and being able to connect our email templates with Novu would be much more convenient and powerful.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Adding templates is rather simple, Brevo requires the addition of two parameters (templateId, and params) to the request body.

templateId is an int, and params is an object.

The customData property, in 'overrides.email', could be used. The SendGrid provider already implements this function in the same way.

2069345125,5054,🚀 Feature(self-hosting): AWS SES without access key when running in environment that assumes an IAM role,"### 🔖 Feature description

When self-hosting in AWS, it's likely that the environment that is running the api and worker code are running somewhere that automatically assumes an IAM role. If this role has the correct (`ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail`) permissions, then creating an SESClient and providing *no* credentials results in the client picking up the role from its environment and not needing an access key. It'd be nice if we could opt in to using this method instead of providing an access key that Novu then stores in its database (even encrypted).

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Authenticating in this manner is more secure than creating an IAM user and managing an access key, and is generally the suggested method when operating inside the AWS ecosystem nowadays.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I've already tested it by modifying SESEmailProvider to check for a specific value of accessKeyId and secretAccessKey and omit the credentials key when instantiating the SESClient, and that's the minimal change required to get it to work (and it does work!). That's probably good enough, since this feature is pretty poweruser anyway and including an extra checkbox in the SES provider's settings seems like it'd worsen regular users' experience. 

The complication that needs to be solved is that this feature would likely need to be opt-in via env var and *also* only work if DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION is enabled.

2069154165,5053,🐛 Bug Report: Headless Client Page Based Pagination Error,"### 📜 Description

This problem affects the headless client and might affect the prebuilt notification center components as well.

Currently when fetching user notification using `HeadlessService#fetchNotifications` page based pagination is used with
a page number and an optional limit.
This returns notifications for a user with notifications sorted by createdAt date descending, so newer notifications are first in list.

However, when new notifications are created this page number has now a wrong offset as the newer notifications are inserted in front of th existing ones. This means fetching the next page will return previously fetched notifications as well.

A cursor based pagination would solve this problem as this is not dependent on the order of elements or if elements are added or deleted. This could be both for the oldest notification fetched as well as for fetching newly created notifications.


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Fetch notifications in the headless client (`HeadlessService#fetchNotifications`) with page set to 0
2. Insert a new notifications
3. Fetch again with page set to 1

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should return the next notifications given the page and limit correctly.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It returns previously fetched notifications as the page number is not correct anymore.

2068230102,5052,🐛 Bug Report: Docker containers always try to build enterprise version,"### 📜 Description

The dockerfiles use the syntax:

```
RUN if [ -n '${BULL_MQ_PRO_NPM_TOKEN}' ] ; then echo 'Building with Enterprise Edition of Novu'; rm -f .npmrc ; cp .npmrc-cloud .npmrc ; fi
```

But since single quotes are used in the if, string interpolation isn't performed, and the literal string '${BULL_MQ_PRO_NPM_TOKEN}' is always non-null. Thus the npmrc swap is always performed.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

`pnpm docker:build` without BULL_MQ_PRO_NPM_TOKEN set. Observe the build output echo ""Building with Enterprise Edition of Novu""

### 👍 Expected behavior

~It should use double quotes instead of single so it actually works as intended.~

2067411915,5051,🐛 Bug Report: Missing server api endpoints compared to client,"### 📜 Description

I think the server api is missing certain functionality compared to the client's one.

1. Delete all messages
This is possible in the client sdk implementation when the feed id is set to null but the server api specifies that the feedId
is required

2. Fetch all messages given a filter
In the client sdk we can fetch unread/read messages, the server api does not provide a filter. It is possible to fetch notifications and restrict them to a channel but nothing more.

3. It does not seem possible to fetch a single message given their id. This is of relevance due to point 4.

4. Something that I noticed is that a client can delete a notification given the messageId only. I assume the endpoint checks the given subscriber id, so a subscriber can only delete their own messages. On the server api there is only a delete given the message's id. In order to check if the message actually belongs to the user then I would need to fetch the message first which I think is not possible due to (3.). The server should probably accept the subscriber id as well and only delete the message if it actually belongs to the subscriber.


I went through the api reference (https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/overview) but I might have gotten something wrong. I am happy for all clarifications.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. I compared the server api vs the novu headless service api

### 👍 Expected behavior

The server api should at least have the same capabilities as the client sdk api in allr egards

They do not match see my description in the bug report

2067326051,5050,🐛 Bug Report: Cancelling Scheduled Event Edge Case,"### 📜 Description

Hi, Novu team! Thanks for the amazing product. 

When scheduling an event a lot of users (multicast or broadcast to huge number of subscrbers), let's say the time this takes is 10 minutes (maybe a million users). If we were to call the cancel endpoint in the middle of that 10 minutes span, the cancel endpoint would only cancel jobs that have already been created (scheduled).



### 👟 Reproduction steps

Run a script to create a lot of users (like > 10k)

Schedule it to a certain point in the future.

As soon as you schedule, cancel immediately.

Some of the messages will still arrive because they were created after the cancel event.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Perhaps we should keep track of which transaction id got cancelled and check that along with the job status enum?

In the transaction `cancel-delayed-usecase.ts`

```ts
    await this.jobRepository.update(
      {
        _environmentId: command.environmentId,
        _id: {
          $in: transactionJobs.map((job) => job._id),
        },
      },
      {
        $set: {
          status: JobStatusEnum.CANCELED,
        },
      }
    );

   // HERE
   markTransactionIdAsCancelled(command.transactionId);
```

and then in `run-job.usecase.ts`, we check the cancel status like so

```ts
  @Instrument()
  private async delayedEventIsCanceled(

### 👍 Expected behavior

I used the documentation and created a subscriber like so
```
subscriber = SubscriberDto(
   subscriber_id=your_subscriber_id,
   email=""a@b.com"",
   first_name=""John"",
   last_name=""Doe""

the sucscriber was created successfully in the dashboard but I was then able to run the same code and it seems the subscriber was created successfully again. I would expect to get a conflict error considering the subscriber ID is the same and it's unique

2058990137,5033,🚀 Feature: Add the ability to specify SNS origination number when publishing,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently, the publish command for SNS looks like the following:
(https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/providers/sns/src/lib/sns.provider.ts#L31)

```js
  const publish = new PublishCommand({
    PhoneNumber: to,
    Message: content,
  });
```
It is my recommendation that a new field be added in the configuration: `Origination Number`.

This will allow users to assign a particular integration in Novu with a specified number from AWS SNS.

Potential code solution:

```js

...
let publishCommand: PublishCommand;

if (this.config.originationNumber) {
      publishCommand = new PublishCommand({
      PhoneNumber: to,
      Message: content,
      MessageAttributes: {
          'AWS.SNS.SMS.SenderID': {
            DataType: 'String',
            StringValue: this.config.originationNumber // Specify your origination number here
          }
        }
    });
} else {
// existing publish command
      publishCommand = new PublishCommand({
        PhoneNumber: to,
        Message: content,
      });
}

const snsResponse = await this.client.send(publishCommand);
...

```

Research:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sms_publish-to-phone.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/sns/command/PublishCommand/

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use-case, we use 1 number to send out general ambulance assignments and communications. We use another number to send out emergency communications.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Add a new option in the UI/API that will allow users to input their origination number. If set, it will add that number to the configuration. This would be optional so there would be no downtime on upgrades for existing implementations.

2058588262,5032,"🐛 Bug Report: UI/UX issue for updating changes in web UI, changes are not persisted if update button is not pressed","### 📜 Description

During any actions when updating workflows it is required that after changing templates, configuring channels or similar for a workflow  that the 'Update' button is pressed otherwise the changes are not applied.

There is no feedback that this has to be done and when opening the workflow settings on the right the sidebar even covers the update button. This makes it highly probable by accident to not apply setting changes.

When changing pages it would be nice that a confirmation modal pops up that allows to save unsaved changes or discard them as well as some visual indicator that there are unsaved changes. In addition, moving the 'Update' button somewhere else that it is not covered by the sidebar would be an improvement as well.

I categorize this as bug and not polishing as this feels serious enough that it could lead to unwanted behavior.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Go to the workflows page
2. Edit a workflow
3. Leave without pressing the Update button
4. Changes are not persisted

### 👍 Expected behavior

- The web ui should ask for confirmation to save or discard changes when routing elsewhere
- Moving the button so that it isn't covered by the right sidebar
- Maybe a visual indicator for unsaved changes

2052487608,5015,🐛 Bug Report: translations are missing in the notification centre,"### 📜 Description

While https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/main/packages/notification-center/src/i18n/languages/en.ts contains 8 strings, most other languages contain 5 strings only. The missing strings are `removeMessage`, `markAsRead` and `markAsUnRead`.

This leads to language confusions in the notification centre, for example with `i18n=""de""` showing a mixture of German and English strings.

I could provide following translations: `da, de, fr, it`

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Add a different language than English to the `NovuProvider`:

```
<NovuProvider i18n=""de"">
  <PopoverNotificationCenter>
    {({ unseenCount }) => <NotificationBell unseenCount={unseenCount} />}
  </PopoverNotificationCenter>
</NovuProvider>
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

All translations within the notification centre should be in German.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Translations for `removeMessage`, `markAsRead` and `markAsUnRead` are missing and the English strings are being displayed instead.

2051811201,5011,🐛 Bug Report:  Headless API issue over removing and refetching queries.,"### 📜 Description

In headless API we use a set of events like **markAs, listenNotificationReceive, deleteNotification, deleteNotifications,etc**. While we use these methods to integrate our custom component with novu we have found some issues. When we make changes to notifications it should **refetch** the queries at certain events and **remove** them for certain events.

1. When a single notification is deleted , the queries to refetch the notifications are removed.
2. When we receive a new notification , the queries are removed.
3. When all notifications are removed . the queries are refetched.

There are few more i'll update it below.

**Though all of these events works perfectly in Notification Center Component.**

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Implement the headless API with infinite scrolling and implement the above mentioned methods so you can observe the behaviour. Compare with Novu Notification Center component. In there these methods are implemented perfectly.

### 👍 Expected behavior

1. When a single notification is deleted , the queries must be refetched.
2. When we receive a new notification , the queries must be refetched.
3. When all notifications are removed . the queries must be removed.
4. When unseenCount changed , the queries must not be removed.
5. When unreadCount changed, the queries must not be removed.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

1. Here I have a screenshot of API calls in debugger. I have used markAs method so it refetched the queries and its correct.

![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/22585439/26899c86-2493-4326-9870-ff60e7b2e480)

2. Now here I have deleted a single notification and it has not refetched any queries and instead removed them. Hence even the next subsequent calls are not happening. Like when I call the markAs method, it is not refetching since the queries are already removed.

![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/22585439/a51728df-e6be-408d-b3a0-25bd248246fa)


Ok now here I will post the code comparision screenshots between Notification Center Component and Headless API.


1. Here is code for delete single notification in Notification Center Component:

It should create cta.action as an empty object not as an empty string, so calling to `subscribers/[subscriberId]/notifications/feed` endpoint may not return an error.

2034242178,4962,🚀 Feature: Make an Endpoint for Handlebars Interpolation Using Existing Templates,"### 🔖 Feature description

We have a panel where the admin can create different types of announcements. These announcements are tied to different workflows, and each of them have their own custom handlebars in app template. Some are cosmetically complex. It'd be nice to have an endpoint that we can just call to have the templating engine on novu backend do the interpolation and return the resulting html back. Something like this:




### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Right now, we have to manually find the template by getting the entire detail of a workflow, then look for a specific step, extract out the handlebars template and then on our react admin panel, use the data input by the admin and interpolate using the handlebars package.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

To have a new endpoint specifically for previewing things. A possible interface in the sdk might be:

```ts
novu.workflows.previewTemplate({
    name: workflowName,
    payload: {
          announcementName, 
          announcementDescription,
    },
    step: 1,  
});
```

The endpoint returns a string representing the interpolated content using the handlebars template and the given payload of the specified workflow and step.

2033022114,4961,🚀 Feature: ✨ Enhancing User Experience: Workflow Group Preferences,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently, user preferences are implemented at the individual workflow level. It would enhance user experience if we could extend this functionality to operate at the workflow group level. This way, users wouldn't need to navigate through all the workflows individually on the frontend (React SDK). Instead, they could manage preferences at the group level, enabling them to toggle visibility for an entire group of workflows, either turning them all off or on with a single action. This streamlined approach provides users with more efficient control over their preferences


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?


We are introducing a user experience enhancement where managing actions on individual workflows is streamlined. Let's illustrate this with two sets of workflows:

1. Leave Request Workflows:
```

1. leave-request:create
2. leave-request:approve
3. leave-request:update
4. leave-request:reject

```
These are grouped under `leave-request`. In the frontend application, only the ""leave-request"" workflow group is displayed. Users can use a single switch to enable or disable notifications for all four workflows within this group. This simplifies preference management, allowing users to control notifications for all related leave request workflows collectively.

2. Timesheet Workflows:

```

1. timesheet:create
2. timesheet:approve
3. timesheet:update
4. timesheet:reject

```
Similarly, these workflows are grouped under `timesheet`. Instead of displaying all eight workflows individually, we present only the two workflow groups, ""leave-request"" and ""timesheet."" Users can toggle preferences for entire groups, providing an efficient way to control notifications without the need to interact with each workflow separately. This streamlined approach enhances usability and reduces complexity in the frontend application.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/50845652/b4830965-0387-462b-ba89-dc548f1328f6)

As you can see in the above image I don't want to show all these workflows individually which are grouped under leave-request

Certainly! If you prefer to display only the ""leave-request"" workflow group in the notification center of the frontend app using the React SDK, the updated visual representation would showcase only this specific group. Here's a description of the expected image:

In the notification center of the frontend app (React SDK), you will now see an image that highlights the ""leave-request"" workflow group exclusively. This focused view eliminates the clutter of individual workflows and allows users to toggle notifications for the entire ""leave-request"" group with simplicity. This design choice aims to enhance user clarity and streamline the interaction with workflow preferences in the notification center.

2032970574,4960,🐛 Bug Report: Notification fails due to subscriber not having channel configured for push channel,"### 📜 Description

We have a workflow that sends out an email and a push notification to all of our subscribers. Push notifications are opt-in on our platform so while the subscriber will have an email channel they may not have the push channel configured if they didn't opt-in. This leads to a lot of our notifications displaying like this in the activity feed:

![CleanShot 2023-12-08 at 10 18 52](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/5090577/7c310cbb-653d-4599-9800-f5adcb2a4243)

IMO the notification didn't fail to send, the subscriber just didn't have the channel configured. Is it possible to skip a workflow step if a channel isn't configured for a subscriber? This is really bloating our activity feed with lots of failures when in fact they aren't actually failing. Our worker logs are also displaying a lot of the same errors and it's causing a lot of noise in our logging for no reason.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Create workflow that has an email step and a push notification step. Send a notification to a subscriber that has the email channel configured, but not the push notification channel.

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should skip the push notification step if the subscriber doesn't have the channel configured. 

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The notification fails due to the channel not being configured.

```
await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', PushProviderIdEnum.PushWebhook, {
  deviceTokens: ['ANY_RANDOM_STRING'],
  //set webhookUrl to override here

2014136836,4907,🚀 Feature: Expose Public API to Invalidate Cache,"### 🔖 Feature description

Every time I make changes to notification templates, I have to manually invalidate the entity cache in redis in order for the next queries to receive fresh template data. It'd be nice to have a public API that allows us to invalidate specific caches.

For now, I think this is the part that intercepts my get template detail call and return cached data 

https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/apps/worker/src/app/workflow/usecases/send-message/send-message.usecase.ts#L314



### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

My use case is that we want the data to reflect immediately every time we edit a template. Right now, we have to go into redis and delete these manually:

<img width=""425"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/56601823/c5958718-1b9d-4653-b057-ccff4e5ebb6e"">



### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

PUT notification-templates/{template-id} should invalidate the entity cache.

We could, of course, invalidate the keys by interacting with redis API directly, but we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot later when the implementation details  -- the keys -- change.

**_Edit: I noticed that I said `PUT` endpoint here. That's not the case. I forgot that we were actually promoting the changes not calling the put endpoint directly because we had problems with the production, not development environment._**

When clicking on ""Run in Local Machine,"" the current behavior is redirection to the introduction page instead of the expected behavior of redirecting to the ""Run in Local Machine"" page. This issue prevents users from accessing the intended functionality directly. Making it difficult for the users to reach the page 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1 . Go to https://github.com/novuhq/novu/tree/next/apps/api#readme
2. Click on Run in Local Machine 
3.  It is redirecting to introduction page but instead it should redirect to run in local machine page 

The current link - https://docs.novu.co/community/run-in-local-machin
The link should be - https://docs.novu.co/community/run-in-local-machine

Update the redirection logic to direct users to the appropriate ""Run in Local Machine"" page when the corresponding button is clicked.

1996583679,4856,🐛 Bug Report: Email Override is not working when using topics,"### 📜 Description

There is an issue when you try to **override** the **email channel** while triggering topics. The email text , sender name is not getting overridden. Instead it is still sending email using the **template** provided in the workflow 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create a workflow with one more steps. Then create one step for email. (configure the email provider before this step).
2. Configure the email with default template and provide the necessary details.
3. Now create a topic and some users
4. Now trigger the workflow with the created topic and add override for email. You can add **'from'** and **'text'** parameter (we don't need '**to**' parameter since we are triggering a topic).

### 👍 Expected behavior

The email must be delivered to the users who are in that topic with the **overridden text data**.  

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The email is delivered to the users in that topic but the content is from the **workflow template** and is not overridden.

Here is the workflow template:

1995743436,4855,🐛 Bug Report: Running behind Load Balancer with GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH doesn't work,"### 📜 Description

When trying to run novu behind a reverse proxy with a GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH it doesn't work:

This should be possible as per these docs:
https://docs.novu.co/self-hosting-novu/deploy-with-docker#reverse-proxy-load-balancers

When you setup the services to run behind a global context path like company.com/novu

The services don't work. 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

### 👍 Expected behavior

https://github.com/isaiahdahl/novu-reverse-proxy-bug-repro

This repo should just work. 

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It's just a white screen because it's trying to render /manifest.json and /env-config.js off of the root domain when the /novu/web index.html loads.

In the context of my reproduction repo. If you go into the novu/apps/web and add 

```
GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH=
FRONT_BASE_CONTEXT_PATH=
PUBLIC_URL=/novu/web
```

And then docker compose build and up -d

You'll get the app running. But if you try and pass the PUBLIC_URL in from the docker-compose.yml it won't work so it's not ideal.

A long running in-app and/or push notification that is not dismissable until it is marked as done by submitting an event to a workflow or it times/errors out.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This is useful to notify a user of a on-going background activity that is waiting to be completed.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

A workflow is triggered with an option, example ongoing: true

To mark the ongoing notification as complete a request is submitted to update the workflow by its transaction id. This could optionally include a payload that would update the workflows payload.

1994888473,4850,🐛 Bug Report: FCM push notification overrides are only applied to first device token,"### 📜 Description

When sending push notifications with overrides (e.g. setting the type to `data`) to a subscriber with multiple FCM device tokens, only the first registered device will receive the notification with the correct overrides. The first device token might not even be valid anymore, so the notification with the correct overrides might not have been received at all.

Looking at the code it seems that the options object including the overrides is modified in-place, e.g.:
https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/947ab956121aebe070342cbc1853d2f81dc89847/providers/fcm/src/lib/fcm.provider.ts#L66

and this code gets called when iterating over the device tokens of the subscriber:

1992831370,4846,🐛 Bug Report: @novu/notification-center Mark all as seen undesirable behavior,"### 📜 Description

In the `@novu/notification-center` package, when you mark something as ""seen"", that message's `read` state will temporarily be marked as unread when the data is invalidated. 

This causes an issue where, if I had a custom notification card whose message is `read == true`. Let's say that this card shows some type of indicator when a message is unread. When the user clicks on `mark all as seen`, which calls the `markAllAsSeen` method from the `useNotification` hook, the indicator would flash for a few milliseconds.

This is because the read state flips to `unread`, before switching back to `read` again when the new data arrives.

[novu/packages/notification-center/src/hooks/useMarkNotificationAsSeen.ts at caac4b58775a6884a7e85b0055562f6ea62ee3a3 · novuhq/novu (github.com)](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/caac4b58775a6884a7e85b0055562f6ea62ee3a3/packages/notification-center/src/hooks/useMarkNotificationAsSeen.ts#L35C44-L35C49)

<img width=""1017"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/56601823/05721b62-0db4-48bb-b013-38091e6a6ccf"">




### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create one notification.
2. Mark it as read. At this point, the message associated with the notification should now have `read === true`
3. `console.log` the read state, and then call `markAllAsSeen`.
4. You will see that the read state briefly switches to `false` before switching back to `true`.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Should retain the actual read state.

I think the ideal behavior would be to use the `read` state of the current notification instead.

So, from this

```tsx
//...
(infiniteData) => {
            const pages = infiniteData.pages.map((page) => {
              const data = page.data.map((message) => {
                return { ...message, read: false, seen: true };
 //...
```

we change to this

```tsx
//...
(infiniteData) => {
            const pages = infiniteData.pages.map((page) => {
              const data = page.data.map((message) => {
                return { ...message, seen: true };
 //...
```


### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

So I made a mock notification following the steps listed above:

The response is always

<img width=""381"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/56601823/df532c50-1a7b-4235-9680-9eb633f0b3a6"">

But the UI is like this (I'm repeatedly clicking mark all as read in this short clip). Green dot means the notification is unread.

We need the same one but only for APNs infrastructure! Now there's only alert-type push notifications support if we use APNs provider. If you want to investigate into more details — here is [some official doc by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification).

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

My project needs this feature because sometimes we need to update app in the background mode or just wake it up from [suspended/background](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/life_cycles/handling_common_state_transitions#) app state.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

All we need to get a remote push notification on iOS app is a structure below:
```
{
  ""aps"": {
    ""content-available"": 1
  }
  // other custom data details...
}
```

But now we get:
```
""aps"" : {
  ""alert"" : {
    ""title"" : ""Wow!"",
    ""body"" : ""This is an alert-type notification""
    }
}
```

And that's it!

- **Summary**
- I had trouble setting up the example. The server port in the example is not the same as the actual port when I tried it.

- **Other information** 
- I tried adding Novu notifications using the React guide, but there's a problem. The server logging says the server is on one 3000, but it's actually running on a different 3001. 





### Context 🔦

Took me a while to set up the react-quickstart example",,
1986977798,4821,[NV-3054] feature: add number format handlebar helper,"### What?

Novu supports handlebar in step editors

### Why? (Context)

Add a new handlebar helper to transform numbers
This handlebar helper should have these customizations:-

1. Choosing the separator
2. Customizing the no. of digits after which the separator should be added
3. Have customization for the decimal point and separator


Example: 

Code:- 

```
{{numberFormat number decimalSep="","" decimalLength=""2"" thousandsSep=""|""}}
```


Input:- 

```
{""number"": 1000000000}
```


Output:-

```
1|000|000|000,00
```

### Definition of Done

1. Add `numberFormat` handlebar helper
2. Add test cases for this helper
3. Add in [this](https://docs.novu.co/content-creation-design/handlebars-helpers) docs similar to [groupBy](https://docs.novu.co/content-creation-design/handlebars-helpers#groupby) helper

1985551246,4818,[NV-1043] Test Plivo connection when creating/updating integration,"## Why?

Currently, when the user connects a provider from the Integration store, there's no option to `Test the provider connection` before saving/updating it for wrong/bad credentials or other possible issues.

Without the `Test` functionality, the provider connection is saved with the possible wrong credentials and the issue is discovered at a much later stage.

We want to have a `Test` functionality during the connection stage to let users catch the errors as early as possible.

## How?

We will need to create a new method i.e,checkIntegration for the `Plivo` provider.

Path to the file : `providers/plivo/src/lib/plivo.provider.ts`

Look into the Plivo docs and if they provide a dedicated endpoint or method to test the connection, then implement the same inside the checkIntegration method.

If there's no dedicated endpoint/method provided by Plivo, then re-use the `send` functionality of the provider to check and ensure proper integration, and return the errors if any.

1985524827,4802,[NV-1009] Create webhook parser for Sendinblue (email),"**Why**

To be able to give better answers why a message was not sent to a subscriber we need to get some info from the provider with a webhook. (deliverability status, rejection status etc).

**How**

To do this we need to implement these functions inside of the provider:

```
  getMessageId?: (body: any | any[]) => string[];

  parseEventBody?: (
    body: any | any[],
    identifier: string
  ) => IEmailEventBody | undefined;
```

The `getMessageId` needs to return all identifiers that should be the same value as id that is returned from `sendMessage` with help of this we can connect a webhook to the specific message.

`parseEventBody` will get the full webhook body and the current identifier that the body should be parsed for. If there is nothing to parse the method should return `undefined`. 

All returns that is not `undefined` should be an object that is in this format:

```
status: string;

 date: string;

externalId?: string;

attempts?: number;

response?: string;

// Contains the raw content for message from the provider webhook

row?: string;
```

Note that statuses for email needs to be value from `EmailEventStatusEnum` and sms should have a status from `SmsEventStatusEnum.` 

 Example of how to do it can be found in `SendgridEmailProvider`.

`parseEventBody` will get the full webhook body and the current identifier that the body should be parsed for. If there is nothing to parse the method should return `undefined`. 

All returns that is not `undefined` should be an object that is in this format:

```
status: string;

`setup:project` script run `pnpm install` and it modifies pnpm-lock file. Commited pnpm-lock file causes unnecesary additional git conflicts.

```json
...
""setup:project"": ""npx --yes pnpm@8.9.0 i && node scripts/setup-env-files.js && pnpm build"",
...
```

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. git clone
2. run `npm run setup:project` script from root `package.json` file.

### 👍 Expected behavior

I would suggest to run `pnpm install --frozen-lock` inside `setup:project`

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It just modifies pnpm-lock and contributors have to revert changes in `pnpm-lock` or remove `pnpm-lock` from staged files.

Commited pnpm-lock leads to unnecessary git conflicts.

1980833096,4777,🚀 Feature:Sending direct messages to Discord,"### 🔖 Feature description

Sending Notifications to discord privately in direct messages by just using their discord username. i.e. N01R#5334 etc. The goal is the user just gives his discord user ID (example: N10R#5322 or the actual user id)  and he gets automatic discord notifications directly to his direct messages, rather than setting a webhook to the server.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

By sending Direct messages to discord to that one individual, we can avoid the creation of servers and copying with web hooks for users to use the notification to discord from our application. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Keep a separate field in Novu like how we have for emails calling it discord username for each subscriber. Then using a discord bot like how the verifications and terms are being sent (example Mee6), we can have a novu bot to take care of sending this message to this one subscriber. This could be a way in which I would only need to store my user's discord username in my application and send the notification through Novu rather than it being in a discord webhook.

1978955366,4770,🐛 Bug Report: Node SDK ITopicPayload Has Wrong Type,"### 📜 Description

Use this curl command, replace the apikey and remove either `key` or `name`. You will get an error like the attached screenshot. If this is correct, then the node sdk should change its type to match.

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:5001/v1/topics' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  ""name"": ""something sdfsd"",
  ""key"": ""something sdfsd""
}'
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

Either backend and documentation update `key` and `name` to be optional, or the node sdk change its typescript type to be mandatory.

1976060918,4757,[NV-3056] Enable to copy transactionId from the activity feed,"### What?

The user is unable to copy transactionId from the activity feed. In the activity feed page, we show notification items with `transactionId` and `suscriberId`.

![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/34ca7e52-10f6-4678-8c4f-bde5dd05488d/c5c9d8fa-69a1-4888-b87e-0c1322115531?signature=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwYXRoIjoiL2YxM2YxOTk2LWM5YjAtNGZlYS04ZWU3LTJjM2ZhZjZhODMyZC8zNGNhN2U1Mi0xMGY2LTQ2NzgtOGM0Zi1iZGU1ZGQwNTQ4OGQvYzVjOWQ4ZmEtNjlhMS00ODg4LWI4N2UtMGMxMzIyMTE1NTMxIiwiaWF0IjoxNjk5MDEzNzkxLCJleHAiOjE2OTkxMDAxOTF9._Kd02SKe8GN8NPft5i8i875HcaUkQeI469R5MSanGhY)

### Why? (Context)

When a user shares any issue with us, we need to check transactionId. But It is not an easy task from user's point of view to copy transactionId. When the user clicks on the item card. A modal is opened with job logs. So the only way is to copy from the developer console.
In my opinion, we can add a transaction ID copy option in the modal like this 

### Definition of Done

* Normal state: display Subscriber ID and Transaction ID without control ""Copy""
* When a user hovers over a card in the activity feed the control ""Copy"" appears on the right side of the transaction ID and a Subscriber ID
* By clicking on the control ""CopY"" a user copies the Subscriber ID and Transaction ID to the clipboard

1975806970,4755,🚀 Feature: Sendgrid Dynamic templates,"### 🔖 Feature description

Is there any possibility to trigger a dynamic template in Sendgrid and passing a variable at this template?
I see from here https://docs.novu.co/channels-and-providers/email/sendgrid that the API key can optionally have the Template Engine read only permission, but I'm not sure if it's used for this purpose or not.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I think many users that are using Sendgrid are already using dynamic templates and thus we don't have to rearrange all of them inside novu.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Inside the Workflow it might be useful, in the sendgrid box, to choos the dynamic template Id and optional params.

### Kind of issue

Missing information

### Issue description

Hi, Novu team. Thanks for the amazing product!

I was looking for a way to run a script to migrate all our existing users and set up the Novu environment (organization, user, integration, etc.) for both our staging and prod environment. I couldn't find anything in the documentation and the source code basically became my documentation and I had to draw my own conclusions about the process Novu takes to setup its environment. Because some of the stuff I found are not documented, I can never be sure that I didn't accidentally depend on some of Novu's implementation detail and end up shooting myself in the foot later.

I think it would be quite nice if there was a script of some sort, or a setup guide for those that want to migrate an existing data or automate the process of setting up their notification environment.


### Context 🔦

A few of our use cases:
1. When we bring Novu to our staging / prod env, create subscribers for existing users.
2. For every single group, create a corresponding topic
3. Subscribe the users within those groups to the group topic
4. We have a number of workflows and feeds and it's inconvenient to manually add that every time while developing locally.",,

1965019347,4674,🚀 Feature: Remove subscription on topic when subscriber is deleted,"### 🔖 Feature description

It would be nice of the deletion of a subscriber would also remove them from all topics. At the moment, the subscribers of the affected topics remain untouched.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

- For data consistency
- To avoid a bloated data base
- Because it's hard to achieve that manually - as far as I can tell I cannot query all topics of a subscriber to revoke the existing subscriptions manually.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The `DELETE` call for a subscriber would trigger some kind of internal cleanup process unregistering them from all topics.  Alternatively, I can query a list of all exisitng subscriptions for that subscriber, so this can be done automatically. The latter would mean more roundtrips and soome potential inconsistency if the subscriber assigned to another topic between my query of their subscriptions and subscriber deletion.

Once embedded attachment support is [enabled in the providers](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/4668), a natural progression would be to allow templates to define embedded attachments that would be forwarded to the providers.

1958711736,4639,🐛 Bug Report: FCM data-type notification expect a message property in the payload,"### 📜 Description

Currently, when sending a data-type notification, it lacks the push message content that was initially set during the push provider configuration step in the workflow. After inspecting the code below https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/bfc3862868ed5b023e18881e3ecbb16b2a638f95/providers/fcm/src/lib/fcm.provider.ts#L69

It turned out that it uses the `body` property instead of `message`.

According to Expo documentation, as stated in [Send notifications with FCM & APNs](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications-custom/), the correct property to use should be `message` rather than `body`. I further confirmed this by introducing a custom field labeled `message` to the payload given that the `data` property essentially combines the different payload and overrides properties. It worked, however, the drawback is that the `message` property originated from the backend, which implies that we would be unable to configure it within the workflow, templates, and internationalization (i18n).

1958612003,4636,🐛 Bug Report: Suggestion to Enhance User-Friendliness through Social Media Handle Logos #638,"### 📜 Description

Currently, you're using text-based links for your social media handles on your website, emails, and other digital communication channels. While this practice effectively conveys the information, it might not be the most user-friendly approach. Users often process visual information more quickly and accurately than text, and the use of logos or icons alongside your social media links can significantly improve user engagement and recognition.

Integrating logos or icons representing each of your social media platforms alongside the corresponding links. This would not only make it easier for users to identify and connect with us on their preferred social media channels but also contribute to a more cohesive and visually appealing brand image.

I would like to fix this. Please assign me. #Hacktoberfest

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Go to Homepage
2. Scroll down the bottom

### 👍 Expected behavior

The expected behavior involves the integration of logos or icons that represent each of your social media platforms next to the corresponding links. This not only simplifies the process for users to identify and connect with you on their preferred social media channels but also contributes to a more cohesive and visually appealing brand image. This approach enhances the overall user experience and reinforces your brand identity, making it easier for users to interact with your social media presence.

Refer to this [Run Novu in Local Machine](https://docs.novu.co/community/run-in-local-machine).

---

## 1. Unable to Login ( Network Error ) ?

Mostly it happens if you did not set up the MongoDB and Redis.

### Solution 1:
Just run `npm run start` and Jarvis CLI will guide you through the process.

### Solution 2:
Setup Docker Manually.

1. Download and Install Docker and keep the Docker application running in the background.
2. Open 4 terminals.
3. First terminal, run these command `cd docker/local/development`  and `docker-compose up`
4. Now run these 3 commands individually in remaining terminals, `npm run start:web` , `npm run start:api` and `npm run start:worker`

---

## 2. Local Host Server Not Starting ?

If you are getting this type of error:

### Solution:
You have to run this command `$Env:NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'`.

It may be possible you get this error multiple times so whenever it happens just use the above command.

---

## 3. pnpm Version is Incompatible with local version ?

When there is a discrepancy between your local package version and the project's designated version, it necessitates the installation of the precise package version aligned with the project's specifications.

Screenshot of the issue:

![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/97605962/108e0f5b-a200-42d9-8796-2f4ad88e2886)

### Solution:
Refer to this link to install pnpm -> [Installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

I personally install pnpm using npm with the help of this command `npm run pnpm@[version_number]`.

In case you installed the wrong version of pnpm, then you may need to uninstall and install again.

1952869622,4593,🚀 Feature: Implement Commit Lint for Improved Commit Message Quality ✨,"### 🔖 Feature description

**Novu currently lacks a commit linting system. Implementing Commit Lint in our project can significantly improve the quality of commit messages, making it easier for both contributors and team members to understand the nature of contributions. This proposal outlines the benefits and steps required to set up Commit Lint in Novu.**

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

- Improved commit message quality.
- Better organization of version history.
- Enhanced collaboration and understanding among contributors.
- Facilitates tracking and reviewing changes.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Step 1: I will Install Commit Lint

Step 2:  Create a `commitlint.config.js` file in the project root with the following content to use the conventional commit convention:

```
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
};
```

Step 3: Add a pre-commit hook to automatically run Commit Lint before each commit. This ensures that commit messages adhere to the convention consistently.

Step 4: Adding contributors to writing meaningful and well-structured commit messages. Emphasize the use of a clear type (e.g., feat, fix, chore) and a concise subject line.

Do you have any plans on making the `expireAt` property configurable?  I have looked at [this release note ](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/releases/tag/v0.14.0) + the source code but didn't manage to find any information on how to configure ttl or `expireAt`.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

 We have a usecase where we want to broadcast some announcements for events, but depending on the types of the events, the expiry date might wary. 

For example, if the event is participatory by nature, i.e.  only lasts for 3 days, then the users that login after that 3-day-period should not be notified of the event. 

Of course, we can work around this by subscribing all users that come online during the active period to that event, but I think that is less convenient that just setting the event to expire after some time.


### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I want to be able to do something like this

```ts
await novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_ID>',
  {
    to: {
      // ...
    },
    payload: {
       // ...
    },
  },
  overrides: {
    // set ttl to 3 days here. Maybe override the ttl config from the env var as well if it's disabled.
  } 
);
```

Basically all users that are logged in within the 3-day period gets this notification, but those that login after, do not. 

If there is already a way to achieve this. Please let me know, I might have missed something. I talked to Novu AI and it was hallucinating wildly, so I assumed it's because this is not really talked about that much.

We'd also be happy to contribute back to Novu if this is already something that's been sitting in your backlog!

1948047891,4562,"🐛 Bug Report:  LogRocket has already been loaded, loading a second instance is not supported.","### 📜 Description

When navigating to the workspace, there is an issue with loading _LogRocket_, which is a tool used for logging and monitoring web applications. The error message suggests that there is already an instance of _LogRocket_ loaded, and attempting to load a second instance is not supported. This issue is commonly caused by loading _LogRocket_ both as a package in the application and as a script tag.

ERROR:
<img width=""625"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/80874246/687c7df2-be63-45e4-aea0-54425a2d7582"">


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Go to the Novu website and click **Get Started**.
2. Navigate towards _Workspace_ and open up the console by bringing in your browser's development tools.
3. Now, Filter out the errors by searching for the above issue or search sequentially in the errors that are in the console.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Ideally, when loading _LogRocket_, there should be only one instance of it in the application. Loading multiple instances can lead to conflicts and errors, as indicated by the error message in the image. To resolve the issue, it is recommended to identify and remove any duplicate instances of _LogRocket_.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The message reads, ""This is off of a script and as a script."" Additionally, the image contains some detected text which says, ""(\otimes \boldsymbol{\nabla}) LogRocket has already been loaded, loading a main.313dce4e.js:sourcemap:2 second instance is not supported. This is often caused by loading LogRocket as a package in your application and as a script tag.""

1947437976,4558,🐛 Bug Report: Missing Sender Name in Mandrill (Email) Provider,"### 📜 Description

`Sender Name` doesn't work in Mandrill Provider, as the [current implementation](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/providers/mandrill/src/lib/mandrill.provider.ts#L46-L58) is missing the `from_name` parameter [required by Mandrill](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/api/messages/send-new-message/) to set up the sender's name in the email.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1.  Setup Mandrill provider in Novu Cloud
2. Create a workflow and implement a email template with Mandrill provider
3. Send a test email and check it in your inbox.
4. You might find there's no sender name.

### 👍 Expected behavior

`SenderName <email@domain.com>` is the expected value in the `from` field in received email

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Actually will only receive `email@domain.com`, although you have set up the `Sender Name` in Novu.

   - [ ] bug report
   - [X] feature request
   - [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
   - [ ] question about how to use this project

 **Summary**
The HeadlessService uses localStorage which isn't provided in react-native clients. It uses the localStorage to store the session token. 

I'd like to be able to use the HeadlessService in a react-native client and need to store the token somewhere else.


 **Other information** 
The token storage seems to be the only issue that's preventing the HeadlessService from working in react-native.

To solve this, I'd suggest to provide a custom tokenStorage option in the HeadlessService constructor, so that a client can provide a react-native compatible storage. 

I have a working implementation for it:
https://github.com/novuhq/novu/compare/next...holi-social:novu:next


I'd gladly open a PR for that. Please assign me to this issue.

1937633276,4492,🚀 Feature: Allow registration by invite when registration is disabled ,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently It's not possible to register when invited if registration is disabled.

This would allow self hosted users to disable public registration while still allowing private invitations.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We want to add new users without allowing anonymous registration and without needing to change environment variables every time.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Change registration to have 3 modes

**Enabled**
Public registration is allowed and active. Same as DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=true

**Invite Only**
Public registration is disabled but administrators can send users invites so they can register

**Disabled**
Completely disable registration, no new users can be registered. Same as DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=false

I'd suggest adding a new environment variables for these values and deprecating DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION.

Example

```
USER_REGISTRATION=disabled # Same as DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=false
USER_REGISTRATION=enabled # Same as DISABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=true
USER_REGISTRATION=invite-only

1933623709,4471,🚀 Feature: Adding Custom Scrollbar and Selection Color to Match Website Theme,"### 🔖 Feature description

This pull request aims to enhance the user experience on our website by implementing a custom scrollbar and custom selection color that align with the website's theme. The changes are designed to improve the overall look and feel of the site, making it more cohesive and visually appealing.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Custom scrollbars and selection colors are essential to improve a website's aesthetics and user experience. By aligning these design elements with the website's theme, it ensures visual consistency and branding, creating a polished and cohesive look. Default browser scrollbars and selection colors often clash with the website's style, making customization crucial for a visually appealing design.  In summary, custom scrollbars and selection colors are necessary for improving aesthetics, brand consistency, user experience, accessibility, and overall website success.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1. Analyze the website's design theme: Understand the existing color scheme, typography, and styling guidelines.
2. Customize CSS styles: Develop custom CSS rules to modify the scrollbar and selection color to match the theme.
3. Conduct cross-browser testing: Manually test the customized styles on various web browsers to ensure compatibility.
4. Ensure accessibility: Verify that the custom selection color provides adequate contrast and readability for all users.
5. Document and integrate: Update code documentation and apply the custom styles consistently throughout the website's codebase, deploying them after successful testing.

1933525085,4469,[NV-3015] Idempotent API Requests Implementation,"Enhance API reliability by introducing Idempotency headers, especially for `POST` and possibly `PATCH` HTTP methods. This will ensure requests are processed only once, even in scenarios of resubmissions due to perceived failures. 

#### **Benefits**
- Improves API reliability and trustworthiness.
- Acts as a precursor to broader system resilience.
- Reduces potential conflicts, data inconsistencies, and duplicate messages.

### 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Leveraging Redis for Caching**
   - Store idempotency keys, prefixed with organization Id and Environment Id.
   - Set TTL for keys to 24 hours.
   
2. **Interceptor Logic**
   - Check if request is of type POST or PATCH.
   - Inspect for Idempotency Header.
   - Interact with Redis cache.
   - Handle potential Redis errors.
   - On return, cache responce.
   
3. **Documentation and Developer Guidelines Update**
   - Update API documentation regarding idempotency headers.
   - Provide guidelines on key generation mechanisms.

4. **Testing**

   1. **Idempotency Key Absence**:
      - Submit a POST or PATCH request without an Idempotency header.
      - Ensure the request is processed normally without any idempotency guarantees.

   2. **Idempotency Key Presence & Cache Miss**:
      - Submit a POST request with a unique Idempotency header that hasn't been used.
      - Ensure the request is processed, and the response is cached with the correct TTL in Redis.

   3. **Idempotency Key Presence & Cache Hit**:
      - Resubmit the POST request from the previous scenario using the same Idempotency header.
      - Confirm the Interceptor fetches the response directly from Redis, bypassing any further processing or database interactions.

   4. **Redis Error Handling**:
      - Simulate a Redis outage or error.
      - Submit a POST request with an Idempotency header.
      - Ensure the request is processed normally without any idempotency guarantees, and appropriate error handling is in place.

   5. **Non-POST Request Processing**:
      - Submit a non-POST request (e.g., GET) with an Idempotency header.
      - Confirm the Interceptor does not enforce idempotency and the request is processed as usual.

   6. **Testing Specific Endpoints**:
      - For all mentioned PATCH endpoints, test the behavior with and without the Idempotency header.
      - Ensure the system behaves correctly, either processing normally or fetching from cache as expected.

1930874314,4452,[NV-3009] 🚀 Feature: Typescript SDK - Add Exponential Retry Mechanism with Idempotency Headers,"In order to enhance the resilience and reliability of our SDK, we would like to introduce an Exponential Retry mechanism for retrying failed requests. Additionally, to ensure the idempotent processing of requests, it's vital to incorporate support for providing an Idempotency Key as per the draft specified in the [HTTP Idempotency Key Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/).

The key requirements for this implementation include:

1. **Exponential Retry Mechanism**:
   * The SDK should retry failed requests following an exponential backoff strategy to minimize the contention and impact on the systems involved.
   * The SDK should ensure that the retry mechanism is configurable (e.g., max retries, initial delay, maximum delay).
2. **Idempotency Key Provisioning**:
   * The SDK should allow for either automatic or manual provisioning of an Idempotency Key for each request.
   * The Idempotency Key should conform to either CUID, ULID, or UUID formats as specified in the draft.
   * The Idempotency Key should be included in the HTTP Header as `Idempotency-Key` and following the standards outlined in the draft.
3. **Configuration and Documentation**:
   * The SDK should provide configuration options for enabling/disabling the Exponential Retry mechanism and Idempotency Key provisioning.
   * Comprehensive documentation should be provided explaining the configuration options, operational behavior, and the benefits of using the Exponential Retry mechanism along with Idempotency Keys.

Acceptance Criteria:

* [ ] Implementation of the Exponential Retry mechanism with configurable parameters.
* [ ] Provisioning of Idempotency Keys, either automatically or manually, conforming to specified formats (CUID, ULID, or UUID).
* [ ] Adequate unit and integration testing to ensure the robustness and reliability of the implemented features.
* [ ] Comprehensive documentation on the usage and configuration of the Exponential Retry mechanism and Idempotency Key provisioning.
* [ ] Adherence to the specifications outlined in the [HTTP Idempotency Key Header Field draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/).

Please refer to the draft for further details on the HTTP Idempotency Key Header Field and ensure adherence to the specified standards while implementing this feature in the SDK.

**Update**: You can reference the go-lang library to keep the method signature and configuration the same.

1930417879,4448,🚀 Feature: Allow deletion of a topic without an additional roundtrips,"### 🔖 Feature description

According to the [documentation](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/topics/delete-topic), all subscriptions must be revoked from a topic before it can be deleted. For my understanding, that means that I first have to query all subscribers for that channel (which might be plenty) and unsubscribe each of them. I would be great if I just could force all subscriptions to be revoked implicitly on topic deletion.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

- Performance: I can run a single request instead of one to query the subscribers, multiple ones to revoke each subscription, and another one to finally delete the topic.
- Performance: Since the list of subscribers could be rather big, I might have to deal with a huge response 
- Leaness: our workflows (which are running novu queries) wouldn't have to be bloated with internal complexity, rendering then more maintainable and less prone to errors
- Consistency: even if I revoked all subscriptions, the topic deletion could still fail when in the meantime a new subscription was created.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Well, ideally there's an internal way to revoke all subscription without querying the subscribers explicitely - anything else might cause the delete request to become more heavy than one might suspect.

1925009337,4374,🐛 Bug Report:  In the press kit file  space img not responsive,"### 📜 Description

In the Press Kit file, there is an issue with non-responsive images. When viewing the Press Kit on various screen sizes and devices, the images do not adapt or scale appropriately, causing them to appear distorted or cut off.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Open the Press Kit file on a computer or mobile device.
Resize the window or view the Press Kit on different devices with varying screen sizes.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The images in the Press Kit should automatically adjust their size and proportions to fit the available screen space, maintaining their aspect ratio and ensuring they are fully visible and legible.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The images in the Press Kit do not respond to changes in screen size or device, leading to issues like:

Images being cropped or partially hidden.
Images appearing stretched or distorted.
Difficulty in viewing the complete content of the images.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

Additional Information:

It is important to ensure that all images included in the Press Kit are responsive to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience for all viewers, regardless of their device or screen size.
Consider using responsive image techniques, such as using CSS properties like max-width: 100% and height: auto, or utilizing responsive image libraries like srcset and sizes attributes for <img> tags.
Test the Press Kit on various devices and screen sizes to verify that the images adapt correctly.

1923093931,4341,🚀 Feature: Elixir client SDK,"### 🔖 Feature description

I would like to implement a client SDK for the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) programming language. It’s most used for resilient, fault tolerant and low-latency responses apps, which includes an awesome web framework called [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org) that also includes a SSR/SPA like framework called [Phoenix Live View](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view). The last one is also being tested to build native apps ala Flutter with [Phoenix Live View Native](https://github.com/liveview-native).

In conclusion, the Novu API SDK would be a great addition to the Elixir community deps, which always prefer and colaborate with OSS projects.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Of course one could implement a interface handcrafted for Novu in Elixir! There are tons of HTTP clients, parsers and so on to do so, but it would be cool to have an official SDK for Elixir that already leverages and abstract some features into a well documented and standardized features implemented with good practices and leveraging the Erlang/OTP benefits!

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I’ll take your API documentation but also will take a look into another SDKs to check a possible pattern. Specially the ruby one as Elixir syntax is very similar.

## Why? (Context)
It does not look like a part of the application with borders and creates visual clutter.
It also behaves strangely for some pages. Like in the WF editor, it shouldn't appear at all, because there is not so much content. It also does not allow you to scroll down, feels like Novu is frozen :-0

## Definition of Done
- The scroll displays only when the content of a page(section) is bigger than a container of the content (so in the WE it shouldn't appear when the content is fit into the container
- The scroll uses the same scroll component everywhere
- The component with 8px height max (see the component in Figma)
- The visible scroll body is 4px and it's 40% transparent (see the component in Figma) 
- The component background is 100% transparent
- The scroll should perfectly fit into the container with the scrolling content

### Kind of issue

Missing information

### Issue description

I would like to start a dev environment for novu without having to configure everything as described here:

https://docs.novu.co/community/run-in-local-machine 

The above guide does not use Docker compose and requires a local installation of all the dependencies (including the databases, services, etc)...

So I went here:

https://docs.novu.co/self-hosting-novu/deploy-with-docker

However this seems for production, it uses the novu images from the online container registry, not the local code.

Can you please provide a clear explanation about starting novu locally for **development** using **Docker / Docker compose** or similar?

Display the current version of the Novu product. 

**Note:** 

* The potential solution could be to introduce the env variable that will be set during the build in the Webpack configuration, then use that variable inside the Web app

## Why?

So users can know what current version they are running when self-hosting. This can help us identify support issues related to old versions and etc…

1915624856,4218,🚀 Feature: Pushpad provider for web push notifications,"### 🔖 Feature description

It would be nice to have [Pushpad](https://pushpad.xyz) as a provider for web push notifications (it is one of the main providers for web push and we are also the maintainers of Ruby `web-push`).

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

An integration is needed to send web push notifications from Novu to the browser using Pushpad.

Pushpad notifications are delivered even when the website is closed, because Pushpad uses the Push API standard.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Add a Pushpad provider for ""push"" messages.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Sending a notification to Pushpad is a simple POST request:

```
curl -X POST 'https://pushpad.xyz/api/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=""AUTH_TOKEN""' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d '{
    ""notification"": {
      ""title"": ""Web Notification Example"",
      ""body"": ""Hello world!"",
      ""target_url"": ""https://example.com""
    }
  }'
```

The above code will send a broadcast notification to all the subscribers of a website.

You can also target specific users by listing them:

```
curl -X POST 'https://pushpad.xyz/api/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=""AUTH_TOKEN""' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d '{
    ""notification"": {
      ""title"": ""Web Notification Example"",
      ""body"": ""Hello world!"",
      ""target_url"": ""https://example.com""
    },
    ""uids"": [""userID1"", ""userID2""]
  }'
```

I am new to Novu, but this should be enough to send a web push notification using Pushpad.

If someone with deeper understanding of the Novu architecture could draft a pull request, I can definitely provide help and answers for the Pushpad side.

1910804701,4198,🐛 Bug Report: Switch style messed up when adding a long description ,"### 📜 Description

On the integrations page, within the integration popup, when a switch component is present as part of an integration option, and that switch component includes a lengthy description, there is a formatting issue where the description and the input element are not properly aligned.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1- Edit/Create integration and that integration has a switch component and add a description to that component 
2- open integrations pages
3- open the integration dialog 


### 👍 Expected behavior

I believe it would be more visually appealing if the description were placed on a new line, separate from the input wrapper.

1903192867,4172,🐛 Bug Report: Helm values file misses `Values.web.env.NODE_ENV`,"### 📜 Description

I cloned novu, set up a kubernetes cluster and tried to install it. I got

% helm install my-release .                  
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: template: novu/templates/web/deployment.yaml:96:38: executing ""novu/templates/web/deployment.yaml"" at <.Values.web.env.NODE_ENV>: nil pointer evaluating interface {}.NODE_ENV

We get a nil pointer because the value doesn't exist.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Hello,

I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to Kubernetes. Here's what I did:

1. Created cluster on EKS
2. Downloaded the kubeconfig
3. Switched to the context that points towards my cluster I just created on EKS
4. git clone <novu-repo>
5. cd `docker/kubernetes/helm`
6. Tried to install the Chart.yaml file:

> `helm install novu-test .`
> 
> Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: An error occurred while checking for chart dependencies. You may need to run `helm dependency build` to fetch missing dependencies: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: redis, mongodb, common, localstack

Was a bit confused to see this error, my experience is too low to really judge this.

7. `rm Chat.yaml`
8. `helm dependency build` -> ok
9.  Retried installation:

> `helm install novu-test .`
> 
> Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: template: novu/templates/web/deployment.yaml:96:38: executing ""novu/templates/web/deployment.yaml"" at <.Values.web.env.NODE_ENV>: nil pointer evaluating interface {}.NODE_ENV

10. Inspct `values.yaml` -> has no web.env.NODE_ENV -> error makes sense


So what do I do now? Why is the env var missing?

Edit: I also tried to check out a specific verison: `git checkout v0.19.0` but still, same issue.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The command installs the chart

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Could it be, that we simply have to change

`.Values.web.env.NODE_ENV` to `.Values.api.env.NODE_ENV`?

1900281967,4163,🐛 Bug Report: Variable not Working in Subject with SMTP Email Provider,"### 📜 Description

When using the variable `{{subscriber.lastName}}` in the Subject line with the SMTP email provider, the variable is not getting replaced with the actual value. Instead, it only shows ""Hello, "" as the result.

- The payload being used is:
```
{
  ""subscriber"": {
    ""lastName"": ""John""
  }
}
```


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Send an email using SMTP email provider with the subject as `Hello, {{subscriber.lastName}}`.
2. Check the received email.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The subject of the email should be ""Hello, John"".

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The subject of the email is ""Hello, "".

1894215767,4154,🐛 Bug Report: Order messages seen,"### 📜 Description

If I mark the notification/message as seen, it's moved at the end of the pagination when I retrieve the messages from the API /messages?subscriberId=whatever

The list of messages is ordered based on the notification status ""read"" or ""seen"".

I read all the documentation and I don't found anything about this behavior. I need to use the /messages endpoint because in my use case I need to read if the notification is read/seen or not. I think the /notifications endpoint works properly ""order decendent"" based on the creatAt date but this one doesn't help me because them does not have the read property.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

To replicate this behavior is simple:

- Create 3 notifications and fill the content with ""noti 1, noti 2 and noti 3"" for easy identification.
- Then retrieve the notifications using ""/messages"" endpoint but with this settings ""&limit=2"". You must see ""noti 3"" and ""noti 2"" so far perfect.
- Mark the ""noti 3"" as read/seen true and when a repeat the previous step... Now the result is ""noti 2"" and ""noti 1"". The ""noti 3"" was moved at the end, it means moved to the next page based on my limit param.



### 👍 Expected behavior

I would expect to hold the same pagination order regardless of the message status (read/seen). Or I'm wrong assuming this behavior? Thanks!

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

1882511122,4109,🚀 Feature: Schedule broadcast notifications,"### 🔖 Feature description

We are implementing Novu in our system for notifications, alot of system emails, and timely marketing emailsthat would require a user to be subscribed but are triggered in code once they meet some criteria or go through a flow etc.

We have previously been using Mautic for all of this (though only sending emails) and it's been a brutal experience over the years. 

The only feature that's missing in Novu that is going to stop us from completely dropping Mautic is the ability to schedule and send an email to a segment of users... a one off broadcast email.

The [topics ](https://docs.novu.co/platform/topics) feature in Novu seems like it comes close to this.  In theory, even currently I could program an API internally around this to create a topic to replace our main-broadcast ""segment"" and then handle scheduling logic on our side and send notifs to the topic. But it seams to me like this kind of a feature would fundamentally fit quite well in the Novu ecosystem.


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use case I want to have my marketing & copy people all work out of one ecosystem, managing the comms to our users in one unified platform that just works. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I would want this feature to introduce two new sidebar tabs.

### Segments 
Segments could be Topics behind the scenes.
The purpose of the segments tab is to give the admin an overview of how many subscribers there are in each segment. Separating it from topics semantically would allow for an implementation to make use of topics like 'posts:comment:12345' and not have to view those in the dashboard view. 

Each segment would ideally have a detail view where you could see the subscribers list.

Having some sort of CSV import feature to ingest subscribers would be super valuable as well, but not a dealbreaker for this feature.

### Broadcast
The broadcast tab would be very similar to the workflow tab, except that some different information would show in the view, as semantically ""Workflows"" doesn't really fit well with a broadcast notification.

The detail view of a Broadcast notification would be the same as the Workflow view except for in the settings, it would have the ability to schedule a time to start the send. Again behind the scenes, this could make use of the ""delay"" feature except you aren't setting a patch to the payload, your specifying it in app. 

Building ontop of workflows would allow marketers to do some really interesting things. Especially if we added something to the workflow like a boolean logic action, 


### 🔄️ Additional Information

These are just my thoughts and before I added more I'd at least want to see if there is interest in this feature. The reality for my situation is that we will probably end up building something internally to do this anyway eventually because of our disdain for Mautic, but I just think this would be such a great feature in this app. 

I'd be willing to be more involved in this feature, from design conversations to development but It's definitely something I'm not just going to tackle without some feedback and discussion.

I really think this could take Novu from a notification infrastructure project to a full-blown notification & marketing

1874143965,4056,🚀 Feature: Configurable HMAC encoding type in email webhook provider,"### 🔖 Feature description

![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/5238147/bad87984-6995-482e-9f20-4269fddfee7a)

We would like to make it configurable how **Secret Hmac Key**, passed to email webhook provider's configuration is interpreted. 

Currently it's interpreted as text but we need a way to pass Base-64 encoded binary value because of AWS KMS requirements. Potentially more cloud cryptography services may need it.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

**tl;dr; 
AWS KMS requires binary HMAC secret key which is impossible to be entered as plain text in email webhook provider's configuration.**

We are using AWS KMS in order to validate HMAC in lambdas invoked by [email webhook provider](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/providers/email-webhook/src/lib/email-webhook.provider.ts). The HMAC is generated by Novu provider using following function:

```ts
computeHmac(payload: string): string {
    return crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', this.config.hmacSecretKey)
      .update(payload, 'utf-8')
      .digest('hex');
  }
```

there is not 3rd parameter passed to `createHmac` so it interprets the `hmacSecretKey` as string.

It seems to not be a problem when you use `crypto` directly in your verification code but in order to make our system more secure, we decided to not retrieve the HMAC secret key to our lambda. Instead we offload the HMAC verification to AWS KMS service. When you upload HMAC secret key there, it's impossible to be retrieved so even if our infrastructure is compromised, the HMAC secret key is still safe.

When we import HMAC secret key to AWS KMS, it has some requirements. One of them is that the HMAC secret key can't be a string (plaintext) key. Usually what you do to generate your HMAC secret key is:
```shell
openssl rand -out HMAC_256_PlaintextKey.bin 32
openssl enc -base64 -A -in HMAC_256_PlaintextKey.bin -out HMAC_256_PlaintextKey.b64
```

While the `*.b64` contains the key in a readable form of: `fka6JxM3aAzrK6usPTV46l52W9KpNvUtqPe3oENkpwg=` (base-64 encoded), the `*.bin` is far from being readable containing non-printable characters.

**All it means that:**
1. Novu signs the body with HMAC secret key interpreted as string, generating HMAC
2. The email webhook provider calls our lambda
3. We pass the generated HMAC to AWS KMS in order to verify it's valid
4. AWS KMS rejects it because it internally interprets the HMAC secret key as binary

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1. On email webhook provider configuration view, below the text field, some control should be added with following options:
    - Text (selected by default)
    - Base-64
    - HEX

2. The selection should be persisted in DB
3. The selection should be used when `computeHmac` function in the provider is executed. Example for Base-64:
    ```ts
    computeHmac(payload: string): string {
        return crypto
          .createHmac('sha256', this.config.hmacSecretKey, { encoding: 'base64' })
          .update(payload, 'utf-8')
          .digest('hex');
      }
    ```

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Workaround is to use `crypto` directly in our lambda which makes us more vulnerable if the infrastructure is compromised & the HMAC secret key leaks outside.

My feeling is that it has something to do with this line of code https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/packages/application-generic/src/services/in-memory-provider/in-memory-provider.service.ts#L227. I'm not sure how the {host, port, ttl} are set from the getRedisProviderConfig method as that returns a couple more values. Also I'm not sure why the getRedisProviderConfig is called twice and the host, port and ttl are not re-used from `this.inMemoryProviderConfig`.

1848543612,3957,[NV-2697] senderName field is missing in resend api and nodejs sdk,"### What?

Novu allows using sender name field in email editor and via overrides. If sender name is Pawan Jain and sender from email is pawan@novu.co, in email clients shows like this `Pawan Jain <pawan@novu.co>`

### Why? (Context)

In the case of resend provider, it does not have a separate sender name field.

Ref API:- [https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email)

currently, there are two ways to handle this:- 

1. use **from** field like this in integration modal

   `        ""email"":{`
   `            ""from"": ""Pawan Jain Novu <pawan@novu.co>""`
   `        }`

Users get confused about why the sender's name is not showing up correctly.

### Definition of Done

1. Novu should automatically handle this at provider implementation

Sending an email in a workflow FAILS when the `payload` object has top-level key of `email`.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

In this steps, I show 3 scenarios that work before to demonstrate the one failing scenario.

1. Create a Workflow
2. Add an Email—add the simplest email with no variables

-   Add: Sender name, Subject, Use Default Layout
-  Editor: ""test""

4. Select Test (in email editor) > Send Test Email (email should arrive in email inbox)
5. Update: Variables:
```
{ ""email"": ""test value"" }
```
6. Send Test Email (email should arrive in email inbox)
7. Close and return to workflow > Get Snippet
8. Run a Test > Run Trigger (email should arrive in email inbox) [do not change any values]

Now, that the email delivery and setup has been shown to work

9. Now, update `payload` (first with key that succeeded)

```
{ ""key"": ""test value"" }
```
10. Run a Test > Run Trigger (email should arrive in email inbox) 

Finally, the failing test
11. Update `payload` again:
```
{ ""email"": ""test value"" }
```
12. Run a Test > Run Trigger [fails]
13. Goto Activity Feed
14. Email: Failed: Unexpected provider error


### 👍 Expected behavior

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The email fails and an error shows in the Activities Feed

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

In diagnosing this bug, I have used the Custom Email provider with an SES Smtp user connection. This all works. The frustrating thing is the poor surfacing of errors.

Note: I have tried other keys that did not fail that could have been a pattern around name conflicts:

- sms
- subscriberId

The current workaround is to not use `email` as a top-level key in the payload. Note, my use case is that email is an object with details for substitution (and not a string).

For Docker image sizes, it is necessary to analyze the factors affecting the image size and find appropriate solutions.<br>
Regarding the monorepo build, we could consider taking advantage of the Tree Shaking feature in NestJS during the build process. This could optimize the build results, improve build efficiency, and thereby reduce Docker image size.

1831549648,3893,🐛 Bug Report: digest not bucketing events with same digestKey,"### 📜 Description

Hey Novu team 👋 ,

I'm leveraging notifications for a workflow in a data acquisition pipeline. The data flow is highly concurrent and event driven.

I configured the digest step as shown (attached img. I'm triggering the notifications and I want to aggregate events that share the same key (e.g. an ULID `id` of domain entity that acts as an aggregator entity on my system), in order to send a single summary email per subscriber (user) of a given topic 

<img width=""1035"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/5887317/74975325-8acb-4aed-be1d-eae4915991cd"">




### 👟 Reproduction steps

Trigger events with a digest key and without guarantee of order

### 👍 Expected behavior

Accordingly to the [documentation](https://docs.novu.co/platform/digest/#digest-key) the events would be aggregated as `subscriberId` + `key`

Taking as data source:

| subscriberId | key |
|--------|--------|
| 123 | abc | 
| 123 | def | 
| 123 | abc |
| 123 | def | 

would end up in sending 2 emails to subscriber `123`, with the following events aggregations

email 1
| subscriberId | key | 
|--------|--------|
| 123 | abc |
| 123 | abc |

email 2
| subscriberId | key |
|--------|--------|
| 123 | def |
| 123 | def |

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It seems it's not respecting the aggregation key, subscriber is receiving an email for events with different keys

| key |
|--------|
| abc | 
| def | 
| abc |
| def | 

below i'm attaching a SS with the events coming in `step.events` array and being rendered by the digest template

I was expecting all the events coming in the `step.events` array to share the same key

1829249049,3888,Preview Environments for Novu PRs?,"Hey Novu team 👋🏽 ,

I'm Romaric from the [Qovery](https://github.com/qovery) team (a Crane backed company as well as you :) ).

I'm a huge believer in the open-source community and absolutely love the work you and your team have put into Novu. It's projects like yours that keep the tech world spinning!

Because of my admiration for open source, I've kickstarted a *Support Open Source Program*. The idea is to offer free access to Qovery, including our cutting-edge [Preview Environment system](https://www.qovery.com/solutions/ephemeral-environments), to selected open-source projects.

But let's talk about why our Preview Environment system is such a game-changer for Novu and your community. With this system, every pull request is spun into a fully functional, isolated testing environment before it gets merged. This can supercharge your workflow in several ways:

- **Test in Real Conditions**: With an isolated environment for each pull request, contributors can thoroughly test their changes in real-life conditions before the code is merged.
- **Accelerate Feedback Loop**: It allows the community to interact with the changes early on and provide valuable feedback, leading to better and faster improvements.
- **Bug Detection**: The chance of bugs sneaking into the production code is significantly reduced, which means less time debugging and more time building cool features!
- **Collaborative Spirit**: It fosters a collaborative spirit within the community by enabling contributors to see the direct impact of their changes and encourages new contributors to participate in the project.

Preview Environments could really enhance the way you work on Novu, allowing you to speed up development, enhance code quality, and make collaboration even more fun and efficient.

I'm eager to discuss how Qovery and our Preview Environment system can support Novu. If this piques your interest, please drop me a line with a good time to chat.

Keep up the fantastic work 💪🏼

1822020572,3858,🐛 Bug Report: Release process,"### 📜 Description

Not sure how to approach this problem but `PaginatedResponseDto` had breaking changes recently:
https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/3792

`totalCount` has been removed and `hasMore` has been introduced.

The changeset is tagged as `0.17.0` which means breaking changes are technically ok. But... the breaking change is already there. We are using Novu & we had no time to migrate our code. The `totalCount` property was not deprecated & there were no communication around it anywhere (unless I missed something).

Assuming you are rolling out `0.17.0` currently but there are no release notes yet. Is it something that can be improved for future releases? My thinking is that:
- Stuff which is about to be removed should be marked as deprecated so developers have time to migrate
- If it happens that breaking changes are needed, it should be better communicated. Are there any channels you can recommend developers can follow in order to be up to date?
- Pre-release notes should be created before rolling out new version so it's more transparent for developers what they should expect

BTW. Great product! Thank you for all what you're doing!

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Call `GET /subscribers` endpoint

### 👍 Expected behavior

`PaginatedResponseDto` returns `totalCount` property

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

`PaginatedResponseDto` returns `hasMore` property instead as there was a breaking change in:

1820548279,3854,[NV-2610] 🏗️ Provide the ability to rearrange steps in a workflow,"**What?**

WF editor steps order

**Why?**

Currently, users won't be able to rearrange step orders, so if they make a mistake and put a step into the wrong order, they may just create a new step in the desired place of a workflow. But he needs to fill in all the metadata for that step all over again. We assume that UX where UI prompts users to do double work in case they made a mistake with a steps order might be confusing.

**How?**

Allow users to reorder steps by **drag and drop.**

**MECHANICS**

* User hover over a step
* UI display D&D hover icon near a step
* User clicks on the icon and drags it Up or Down
* When the step becomes closer than distance 8px to its neighbor, they switch places.
* The dragged step takes the place of its neighbor, the neighbor takes the place of a step that was dragged

By this concept, new users can config multiple dynamic producers around different workflows, and consume messages from novu.
Then, they can programming consumers for their AMQP providers by own language and frameworks.

Because Novu has not very providers. 
Develop a new native provider, need long time, from conversation to develop and release.
Novu is NodeJS based, so when i want use my provider as another stacks, i cant, because every provider should program under nodejs syntax.

1804675892,3797,[NV-2935] 🐛 Bug Report: Wrong provider is selected when sending a push notification (if we have 2 active providers of same type),"### 📜 Description

In the case of the push notifications, given that we have 2 active providers in the same organization: fcm (for android and web push notifications) and apns (for ios notifications), when we have a subscriber that has setup only a device token for ios and we want to trigger a push notification for the specific subscriber, when it goes to select the appropriate provider to send the push notification, instead of choosing the apns, fcm is chosen. This bug is shown in version 0.16.3 . 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Setup fcm and apns providers
2. Create a subscriber that has both an fcm and an apns token
3. Trigger a push notification for this specific subscriber 
3. The first notification (apns for ios) is sent successfully but the second one (android) is not sent successfully since it uses apns instead of fcm (I believe the issue is in selecting the wrong provider when the specific channel has more than one active providers)

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use case, there are notifications of a certain type that don't need to exist for very long in a user's notification center. So an API that runs periodically to delete these notifications [based on some field in their payload] would help enable this.

1776117328,3665,🚀 Feature: add `markAsRead` `markAllUnreadAsRead` & `markAllUnseenAsSeen` in @novu/node,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently we have `markMessageSeen` and `markMessageActionSeen` to update message. It would be nice to have more APIs from widget controllers inside `@novu/node` as we can have more control on notification outside webapp.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently on mobile side, we used our server to call novu API to get notification list via `@novu/node` and behavior on mobile should be the same as notification center, we would like to have more api to control on status of message such as read / seen / read all and seen all.

1774419231,3659,🐛 Bug Report: Upgrade to 0.16.0 ,"### 📜 Description

Novu 0.14.0, which I self-hosted, is currently operating in docker container. I want to upgrade the version to 0.16.0. The repository was cloned, bespoke changes were done according to my specifications, and new containers were created.


While performing the update, I used the URL https://github.com/novuhq/novu/releases as a reference. As per the link I need to run the following commands:

```
npm run setup:project

npm run migration:in-app command from the apps/api folder
```

When I ran the aforementioned instructions from the apps/api folder, I received the following error:

1771646605,3655,🚀 Feature: Self descriptive providers,"### 🔖 Feature description

To be honest, I just want to use the novu providers, but the actual code for that but the provider logic is so distributed around, you need:

1. A provider class
2. A handler class (that usually does nothing useful)
3. Upload the logos
4. Define the config in another place.

So what is usually just a single file, ends up in a lot of places. It would be great to make the providers easier and define an interface where everything is basically in one file. I made a proposal for that for another project: https://github.com/open-notifications/open-notifications/blob/main/service/on-providers/src/providers/messagebird/messagebird-sms.provider.ts

This also violates the Open-Closed-Principle...

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

See above. The plugin system is not a plugin system right now. It is a dependency hell. For example the following interface, which seems to be the union of all integrations:

https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/c0e7b3b5a0de8f14c4b6faaaf10fa61648165999/libs/shared/src/entities/integration/credential.interface.ts#L4

Because it contains all potential credentials, everything is optional, which is obviously not the case. 

Furthermore OpenAPI spec is not very good, because nothing is marked as required:
https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/c0e7b3b5a0de8f14c4b6faaaf10fa61648165999/apps/api/src/app/integrations/dtos/credentials.dto.ts#L20

Even small changes require a lot of files to be changed. For example when a new a property is added, at least 5-6 files need to be modified:
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anovuhq%2Fnovu%20IpPoolName&type=code

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1. Provide a clear interface for providers including the config.
4. Refactor the providers
5. Either create the OpenAPI spec dynamically or just use an ""any"" type for the credentials.

Reference: https://www.brevo.com/blog/becoming-brevo/

New Brevo users might not know they could use Sendinblue provider in Novu.

We need to implement the changes needed to support this rebranding for existing and future users.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1765439432,3626,🚀 Feature: Generic Mail-API provider,"### 🔖 Feature description

I'm proposing here a generic Mail-API provider, which upon triggering, calls a configured API endpoint and parses the notification data into the JSON body of the API request. The mapping of notification -> JSON body can be fully configured in the provider configuration.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Sometimes there are mail providers, which are not available as directly supported providers and never will be. These could be custom-made mail providers in larger organizations or just by some very active developers. However, these providers usually have an API endpoint to call in order to send an email.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Create the generic Mail provider which calls an API endpoint.

1765084988,3624,🐛 Bug Report: refetching broken when using feeds,"### 📜 Description

Websockets should prompt refetching of feeds and counts when applicable.  But in version 0.16 of `@novu/notification-center` I need a refetch interval or notifications will remain stale until a reload. I think that this has to do with the fact that all my Novu usage is using feeds --- both counts and notifications are only fetched per-feed.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. write a notification center which never fetches all feeds
2. send a message to it (in my case from a version 0.15 local server) on a feed it reads

OR

2. delete a message from the notification center from the three-dots menu of that message

### 👍 Expected behavior

- the useFeedUnseenCount hook should trigger a react rerender with an updated value
- the list of messages should trigger a react rerender with an updated value if there's a mounted component with that hook open, e.g. PopoverNotificationCenter

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

- immediately after sending the message from the server, the browser fetches a count of total messages (but doesn't seem to act on it...). That makes me think that at least when this happens, the websockets are still doing something.
![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/5530960/f7f9627c-c154-40e2-b779-fa6524d74467)

- useFeedUnseenCount values don't change until reload
- PopoverNotificationCenter values don't change until reload
- on views that have multiple feeds simultaneously --- and thus multiple providers simultaneously --- I see ""websocket error"" in the console, even when the providers aren't nested.  I think that's new. 
![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/5530960/efb207b7-0a70-402c-b1cc-7fd5b7b5338b)


### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

This worked fine in version 0.13 of the client.
When polling is enabled in one hook, everything else works too.

### 👍 Expected behavior

We are seeing CORS issue with our env.

We are also seeing name not resolved issue sometime.

   - [*] bug report

   - [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

- **Summary**

I'm trying to run novu from the manifests that kustomize generates.

The steps I followed, after cloning the repository, are the following:
```
 cd docker/kubernetes/kustomize
```

Edit env-dev leaving the content attached.

Generate the manifests for kubernetes:
```
 customize build . > novu.yaml
```

Create the namespace in k8s:
```
kubectl create ns novu
```

Apply the manifests:
```
kubectl apply -f novu.yaml
```

Everything worked fine except that the api and worker pods show the following error:

1756799679,3589,🚀 Feature: Better Client Pagination Control,"### 🔖 Feature description

Headless/React hooks client should allow:
- fetching all pages of a tab
- changing the page size

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use-case, messages are associated with an object external to Novu and can be searched by that object's details. This means that client-side filtering needs to occur and I can't know ahead of time which notifications are relevant to what the user is trying to do.

This feature would also drastically speed up notification centers with a different number of items.  For example, the Github notification center shows around 22 items per page. Currently, a view like that would require 3 roundtrips and thinking about timelines of fetching in a not very React way.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

- [ ] add a way to fetch all notifications in the feed to the notification fetching interface (initialFetchingStrategy etc.). Ideally combine with `pageSize` by making `pageSize` `number | ""all""`.
- [ ] add documentation explaining `fetchNotifications` and `fetchAllPages`
- [ ] add a `pageSize` to the provider interface

### 🔄️ Additional Information

It appears that `fetchNotifications` only fetches the first page of notifications?
That violates the principle of least astonishment since there is no other control over pagination/loading and should probably be explicitly stated in the documentation. 
I expected the ""get me out of having to worry about fetching"" setting to fetch all pages, not just the first one.

Hmm, it would be nice if

1754367596,3583,🚀 Feature: Access actor information from notification templates,"### 🔖 Feature description

Allow notification templates to access information provided by the actor's subscriber object.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I want to add a simple connection request notification - ""John Smith would like to connect"". At present, I'm sending { firstName, lastName } as part of the payload, but this is duplicate data as this is also available via the actor (I'm sending { actor: { ... } } alongside the payload: { ... }. It doesn't appear in the default variables when creating a notification template, but it seems like an obvious thing to be able to use, as {{ actor.firstName }}, for example.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Currently, actor information isn't passed into the template builders, it should be a straightforward change to make this available.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried various variable accessors in the template builder UI but none of them worked. On submitting a query to Discord, I was asked to create an issue for this use case.

1751338763,3580,"🐛 Bug Report: Novu notification center ""Mark all as read"" button not doing anything","### 📜 Description

Hi folks, we are using the Novu notification center and our E2E UI tests started freaking out recently. Upon investigation, it turned out they are no longer able to dismiss all unread notifications in the Novu notification center and then validate they have been cleared.

I was able to reproduce the issue by hand. I send my test account a notification and then press Mark all as read and nothing happens. When I click the Mark as read button on the individual notification, it refreshes the whole page and after the refresh there are no unread notifications anymore:

https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/6831144/82985878-198c-478b-bd49-df4626cb8724

I checked the Network tab in the browser developer tools and I see https://api.novu.co/v1/widgets/messages/read being hit with every click. The first time around the response is `{""data"":1}` and all subsequent times the response is `{""data"":0}` so I think the API works, but the Notification Center UI is not reflecting the new state.

This whole thing happens in the Novu `iframe` so I hope it is not our app code breaking this in any way, but it is not impossible I guess, so maybe it is a problem on our end? But then, what could it be to cause the `iframe` to not update its UI after the network request completes?


### 👟 Reproduction steps

I can only reproduce locally on our app. Is there any sort of a Novu Playground or any public demo of the Novu Notification Center where I could try to reproduce?

### 👍 Expected behavior

Mark all notifications as read and update the Novu Notification Center UI to match.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The notifications get marked as read via the API call (as evidenced by the fact that the tab reload shows no unread notifications), but the UI is not updating. See the video above.

As I'm not going to use secure / tls, I have choose to select ignore tls. However it still required to put something into the tls options.

1742865479,3565,[NV-2616] 🚀 Feature: Bulk import subscribers through CSV,"### 🔖 Feature description

It would be very helpful to have an option to import users you already have in your database to Novu by means of a CSV file. The current solution is to iterate through your users and do a `create_subscriber` method for each one of them. This could have potential issues, for example, one of the users failing and being left without subscription in Novu.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my case, I need to add my already existing users to Novu, so they get an email subscription. Afterwards, when each one of them logs onto the app, they would accept push notifications through OneSignal. 

I can't go for the alternative of creating a subscriber on the fly when triggering the notification, I need them to already exist in Novu to associate them to the OneSignal player when it is created.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

A CSV with the information of the subscribers would be uploaded, with the same fields that you input when creating a subscriber through the API. It would be good as well if the CSV supported the capability of adding custom data as well.

1732471743,3541,🐛 Bug Report: Novu Notification Center Closing Issue on iFrame Embed,"### 📜 Description

When you have an in-app Novu notification bell icon, the notification center opens up when you click on the bell-icon, but it doesn't close the center when you click on it again. It closes when only when you click on some other part of the screen.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

- Simply add a Novu notification center iFrame Embed.

```javascript
function showNotification(pair, name) {
  (function (n, o, t, i, f) {
    n[i] = {};
    var m = [""init"", ""on""];
    n[i]._c = [];
    m.forEach(
      (me) =>
        (n[i][me] = function () {
          n[i]._c.push([me, arguments]);
        })
    );
    var elt = o.createElement(f);
    elt.type = ""text/javascript"";
    elt.async = true;
    elt.src = t;
    var before = o.getElementsByTagName(f)[0];
    before.parentNode.insertBefore(elt, before);
  })(
    window,
    document,
    ""https://embed.novu.co/embed.umd.min.js"",
    ""novu"",
    ""script""
  );

  novu.init(""APP_ID"", ""#notification-bell"", {
     ...subscriberProps
  });
}
```

- Add a HTML Div with the bell icon.

```HTML
<link
      rel=""stylesheet""
      href=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css""
      integrity=""sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw==""
      crossorigin=""anonymous""
      referrerpolicy=""no-referrer""
    />

<div id=""notification-bell"">
      <i style=""color: white"" class=""fa fa-bell""></i>
      <span id=""unseen-badge"">0</span>
</div>
```

- Now fire a Notification and click on the bell icon to open the Notification Center.
- Now click on the bell icon again to close this which is not working at the moment.


### 👍 Expected behavior

When the notification center is open and you click on the bell icon, it should close the notification center.
The behaviour should be to toggle the visibility of the notification center alternatively based on the bell icon click.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

When the notification center is open and you click on the bell icon, it doesn't close the notification center.

It would be great if you could add an option where the popover opens automatically as soon as a new notification arrives.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my case I am using Novu on a dashboard application and I want the user to see the notification as soon as it arrives.
For example I want to schedule a maintenance, so I notify the user what time the maintenance will be.
And I want them to see it as soon as it arrives.

1723831063,3495,🐛 Bug Report: race condition in NovuProvider,"### 📜 Description

If two NovuProviders on a page (for different feeds that need to be shown simultaneously) overlap in their loading, they may lock up in a way that might require different steps to unstick --- it might be fixed by opening the notification center, it might need a reload, it might need to be left closed and then opened cold again, potentially from a view that only has one NovuProvider.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Add one NovuProvider to a header
2. Add another NovuProvider to some exotic hook logic
3. add some latency in the network conditions section of the browser dev console
4. Try to load the second before the first is done initializing

### 👍 Expected behavior

Two notification providers should load.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

This might be more likely to happen if a link is clicked than if a URL is pasted into the address bar.  Sounds cursed but it has been easier to reproduce that way.

If you want .har files just let me know.

This is an intermittent issue which is easier to reproduce with higher network latency and harder to reproduce with higher react-related latency, which is why I've labeled this as a race condition.

Hi there 👋,

Given 2 environments, `dev` and `production` (default), each environment has its dedicated api key.

I've noticed that by calling: (https://docs.novu.co/api/get-environments/)
```
curl -X GET \
 -H ""Authorization: ApiKey <dev api key>"" \
https://api.novu.co/v1/environments
```

I would get all environments info, with related api keys (both `production` and `dev`) 🙀 

Long story short, with `dev` api key I get access to `production` environment.

It seems to me like a serious security flaw, why would you want api keys to be returned in this case?</div>

1721795062,3479,🚀 Feature: OneSignal provider overrides to send push notification with external_user_id,"### 🔖 Feature description

Hi, I have seen the onesignal feature provided in latest `0.15.0` release but it seems for now novu is only using `player_id` to target the push notification. I think the `external_user_id` could be easier to use in some scenario (OneSignal handle the device and user relationship instead of Novu). Would it be better if there's some override setting specific for OneSignal?

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use-case there's still some limitation on how to manage `deviceTokens` with Novu `setCredentials` method so it would be easier if I can use overrides value to target the push notification with `external_user_id` instead of `player_id`

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

A new overrides key specific to OneSignal provider should be used and if that key is available, do not use `include_player_ids` args in OneSignal [createNotification](https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference/create-notification) method and use `include_external_user_ids` and `channel_for_external_user_ids='push'` instead

1720243945,3473,[NV-2381] 🚀 Feature: API endpoint to fetch execution details by transactionId,"### 🔖 Feature description

Create a new api endpoint that returns the execution details for events related to a given `transactionId`. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently, we support fetching execution details by `notificationId` and `subscriberId`. However, when we trigger a notification to a topic, we cannot easily get the execution details for all dependencies of that action. 

eg: we trigger a notification to a topic with 100 subscribers. It is difficult to get the execution details for all 100 subscribers.

In this case, it would be helpful to query the execution details by `transactionId`.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Create a new api endpoint (`/execution-details/transaction/:transactionId`) that returns the execution details for a given transaction. 

Since a transaction can have many notifications/subscribers attached to it, I think it makes sense to group each set of execution-details by notificationId/subscriberId.

I would also like to add the ability to filter by status (Pending, Success, Failure). 

The query will also need to be paginated, so the json response should include `totalCount`, `pageSize`, and `page`.

1717906437,3466,[NV-2374] Allow notifications feed filtering by custom payload data,"### 🔖 Feature description

At the moment, we can query notification meessages/feeds by `page`, `feedId`, `seen`, `read`, `subscriberId`, `channels`, etc. It would be helpful to query by custom data in `messages.payload` 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I work on a web app where we are trying to migrate our existing notification systems to Novu. One feature of our existing notification system is that we are able to filter notifications by their 'component type', or a subsection of the app. As we transition to Novu, we can store this custom data within a notification payload, but we run into compatibility issues since we are unable to filter by these features.



### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I would like to expand the `GET /v1/notifications` api to take custom data as input.

Specifically, I think it will involve the following:

- Add a new parameter to`@novu/dal/src/repositories/messages/message.repository.ts > MessageRepository > getFilterQueryForMessage()` to take custom payload data as input
- Update `@novu/api/src/app/widgets/usecases/get-notifications-feed` and the corresponding `StoreQuery` object to take custom payload data

2. Retrieve a list of layouts `novu.layouts.list({ your params})`
3. Inspect the API response

### 👍 Expected behavior

The interface should reflect the actual API response

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

```typescript
const axiosResponse = await novu.layouts.list({ page: 0, pageSize: 100 })
const list = axiosResponse.data
```
You'll observe that `list` will have the following content:

```typescript
{
    page: 0,
    totalCount: 2,
    pageSize: 100,
    data: [ [Object], [Object] ]
}
```

1713719096,3442,🚀 Feature: Export Notification Templates interfaces/enums from SDK ,"### 🔖 Feature description

SDK types are not being exported for consumers, example: `IMessageFilter` interface can't be imported from `@novu/node`

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I'm building a library that generates Novu resources/entities programmatically and there's the need to have type-safety but it is hard to import the types from `@novu/node` as enums such as `DigestUnitEnum`, `BuilderFieldType` etc or any other interface related to notification templates (which is my primary use case) are not available 

The workaround that I have so far is using typescript `Parameters``
```typescript
import type { Novu } from '@novu/node';

export type SdkTemplate = Parameters<
  Novu['notificationTemplates']['create']
>[0];
```

This is not ideal as for some enum fields, we're not even able to pass a literal value and i end up casting to `any`

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

If possible export the types/enums so that the SDK can import, something like

```typescript
import type { INotificationTemplateStep, INotificationTemplatePayload,  ChannelCTATypeEnum } from '@novu/node'
```

### 🔄️ Additional Information

This might apply to other resources, right now I'm only exploring templates

1709658110,3416,[NV-2329] 🐛 Bug Report: Issues with integration `secure` option,"### 📜 Description

After wrestling with some APNs issues over the past week or so, I was not able to get any meaningful debugging insights from the Novu web app, but I realised that there are some potential issues with how the `secure` property is being handled between Novu <> apns.

Currently, it looks to be an optional property, so integrations created without specifying a value for this are effectively `undefined`.

This can have unfortunate consequences in the case of the `apns` package, since it will default to `production` if `NODE_ENV` is set to production (which I believe [is set](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/apps/api/src/.env.production#L1) for Novu api) so if no value exists, production will be assumed by the apns package.

The workaround for this seemed to be ensuring that the property is set to `false`, but this didn't seem to resolve issues. I believe it's an issue with how the `credentials` data is being stored, mainly because the `secure` value is being persisted as a string (""true"" || ""false""). This has the effect in the `apns` package where `""false""` is actually interpreted as [true for any string value](https://github.com/node-apn/node-apn/blob/master/lib/config.js#L94)

I created a quick test in the apn package to verify that this is the case:

![Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 6 53 58 pm](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/123625424/df84a80c-09d0-4617-a1f8-00d4582b379f)

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create an APNs integration via the API excluding the ""secure"" property
2. Fetch the integraton, observing that the ""secure"" property is absent
3. Update the integration via an API call, setting the ""secure"" property to (Boolean) true
4. Observe that the ""secure"" property is being persisted as a string in mongoDB. 

### 👍 Expected behavior

When creating an integration, the `secure` property should be defaulted to Boolean `false` if no value is provided by teh user.

When the value is updated, the value should be persisted as a boolean value, to prevent the kind of ambiguity introduced when using the apns package, and potentially others

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

I'm using the API to update notifications, but this may impact the fix for https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/3360

I've been unable to get e2e tests working to test a fix for this, but I feel like the `secure` property in the DTO should be `@IsBoolean` over `@IsBooleanAny` which was changed in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/commit/4e5b082b0654d6e78b322917a5d74df001e6dd2b - I don't have context on those changes however, and there was probably a reason for that change that core devs know about.

1. When an email contains conditional check such as `{{#if var}}`, the variable is incorrectly parsed as `boolean` with the default value set to `true`. `var` can be any ""falsy"" value such as empty strings or empty nested json objects.

2. After changing the default value to `false`, the value can be reset if you make other modifications. As far as i can tell, promoting to production also resets the default value back to True

As an admin, I would like to be able to enable a provider that allows me to enter custom SNPP credentials that allow for paging through a `emag` gateway.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

As an enterprise user, we utilize a `emag` service that allows us to tie directly into a cell phone providers SMS system for enterprise messaging. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Create a new provider that allows for the entering of the following:
- emag address (i.e. myemag.cellprovider.com)
- emag port (i.e. 1337)
- username (i.e. myuser)
- password (i.e. mypassword)

Since they released their first stable version, I'd like to see support for Qwik framework. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Even though we could use an iframe, or the web component, having a native component would make it easier to adopt Novu on Qwik.

1697718097,3342,[NV-2222] 🐛 Bug Report: mailgun baseurl is missing in handler,"### 📜 Description

I was trying to set up Mail gun integration with Novu, and the integration got created OK, but when I tried to send emails, it consistently failed. The error was also a bit misleading as it always shows `providerId` as null or `SendGrid` whereas I only had one integration which was `Mailgun`.
I looked into the issue and [found out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63489555/mailgun-401-forbidden/63967799#63967799) that the domains in the `EU Region` need to specify the EU `host`. I looked into the codebase and found some issues

1. [mailgun-provider](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/providers/mailgun/src/lib/mailgun.provider.ts#L35) does take custom `url` as a `baseUrl` argument and pass that on to `mailgun-client` but the [mailgun-handler](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/packages/application-generic/src/factories/mail/handlers/mailgun.handler.ts#L24) does not pass `baseUrl`  to the `mailgun-provider`. 

2. Integration Create API does not let you specify `baseUrl`, but it's defined in the interface [here](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/libs/dal/src/repositories/integration/integration.entity.ts#L26)




### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Setup a Mailgun account with a `EU` region domain
2. Setup Mailgun integration on Novu.
3. Try to send an email, you will get an error.

### 👍 Expected behavior

- Should let you define custom host URL in case of `EU` 
- The mail should be sent

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

I get this error in my last step of `executionDetails` of the `job`

```json

It would be greatly beneficial if we had the ability to ""Discard"" a Change rather than only ""Promote"" it. If we make changes to a template in Development, and then want to fine-tune or even revert the change there is no way to ""Discard"" it so it remains in the Change table indefinitely.

Without it, old no longer relevant changes will remain trailing in the Change table unnecessarily.

Simply add a ""Discard"" button beside the ""Promote"" button with a dialog ""Are you sure you want to discard this change?"" to avoid any accidental discards. And perform a delete by ID in the `changes` table in the database

1689243378,3300,[NV-2181] 🚀 Feature: Support for multiple projects,"### 🔖 Feature description

I'd like to be able to support multiple applications under 1 organization because I have distinct sets of subscribers for each application.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently, I'm not aware of a way for to hide notification preferences from some subscribers but not others. I have two subscriber pools ""Pool A"" and ""Pool B"", each has a different set of notifications that may reach them.

I don't want users in Pool A to see preferences for users in Pool B if there is no chance they will ever even get that notification.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I'm new to this codebase and this community but here are some ideas:

**One idea is to add a project dimension which wraps environments**
Based on the current data model, it appears that this likely could be built fairly easily by adding a ""Project"" model, and then nesting ""Environments"" under projects. There would be a default project, with 2 envs ""Development"" and ""Production"".

Users could then add another ""Project"", it would also have two environments. I'm not sure if this would be able to support shared layouts, but that could be an enhancement later, and maybe nested under the org instead of under a project. (would have to be this way because layouts need to be promoted).

The API could then support filtering by project, and sdks could supply project as a parameter as well.

This would work similar to launch darkly:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413949/235266763-0a182ace-4dac-42e9-a957-6f18c5172eb7.png)

**Another idea would be to add ""Subscriber Groups""**

Subscribers could be added to one or more groups, the groups might be named ""Project A"" and ""Project B"". Then templates could also be assigned to one or more groups. Subscribers would only be eligible to receive notifications if the template is not assigned to any groups or the Subscriber and the Template have groups in common. Subscribers would only see notification preferences for templates they are eligible for.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried solving this with topics, which didn't make sense because topics are for fanning out. 

I also considered using environments for this, which could potentially work but the web UI would need to be updated to support multiple sets of dev/prod environments (this is another possible approach i guess but seems messy).

I guess another way I could approach this is with multiple orgs (or even hose the API twice), but then i have to manage two sets of members and it would be very hard to ever share any infrastructure (layouts, providers, etc). Adding support around managing orgs and maybe adding a hierarchy might also solve the problem.

The ""notification group"" feature seemed like it might help, but i can't even really tell what it's for and there is definitely not a way to assign subscribers this way.

I tried to find related issues but didn't have any luck.

If there is already a solution to this that would be awesome!


(I'm leaving ""willing to submit PR"" as none because i don't know what scope we'd be talking about or time commitment, but i'd be open to the idea)

Two things would be helpful here:
- list the different types that steps.template could have and explain when it would have each type
- mention that the web console uses the v1 api, so if you're not clear on what values something needs to take, you can use the web inspector to help figure it out.

1683625229,3288,[NV-2171] 🚀 Feature: Accept br single line tags in Editor mode,"### 🔖 Feature description

The feature request is to add a br tag inside email templates for notifications on Github. This will allow users to add line breaks in the notification emails, making them easier to read and understand. The br tag should be added in a way that it does not break any existing functionality of the email templates.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Email notifications are an essential part of Novu's functionality, as they allow users to stay up-to-date with changes and updates to repositories. However, sometimes the notifications can be challenging to read, especially when they contain a lot of text. Adding a br tag to the email templates will make it easier for users to read and understand the notifications they receive.


### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

To add a br tag inside email templates for notifications on Github, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the email templates that need the br tag added.
2. Modify the code of those email templates to include the br tag where necessary.
3. Test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the br tag is working as expected and does not break any other functionality.
4. Submit a pull request to the Github repository with the modified code.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

The addition of a br tag in email templates for notifications is a relatively simple feature request that will provide significant benefits to users. It is a commonly used HTML tag and should not pose any significant challenges in implementation. Testing should be thorough to ensure that it does not break any existing functionality.

The template should be deleted in Production and all related-pending changes to that template should be gone from the Changes list
It would also be greatly beneficial to be able to ""Discard"" changes and not only ""Promote"" them

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

- The template no longer exists in development, but exists in production and cannot be deleted (not even through the API)
- All older pending changes that have not been promoted are still lingering in the Changes table and can be promoted
- The template which now only exists in production cannot be modified at all

1683184761,3286,[NV-2169] 🐛 Bug Report: Header missing `screen` argument and React identity,"### 📜 Description

There's no React-y way to tell what the current `screen` (i.e. are we looking at notifications or settings?) is from the `header`.

This is because we aren't supplied the current state as a prop, it's not in a context, and the component identity of the header isn't preserved when we `setScreen`.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Supply a custom `header` and try to make a button that changes icons and toggles the current screen with `setScreen`.

### 👍 Expected behavior

The `header` should be given all props it needs to do its job, and its identity should be preserved between render so we can do react things like state.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The `header` isn't given the `screen` prop, and its identity is not preserved when you switch the `screen`.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/6e802807fbb97d3d1b41934fdefa6d87d879ce71/packages/notification-center/src/components/notification-center/components/layout/Layout.tsx#L28
- `header` should be invoked differently (i.e. as a react component with a key) to preserve its identity render-to-render
- `header` should be supplied with the current state as a prop

This bugfix might interact with #3285

Workaround:
If you make a global variable holding the current `screen` that gets reset to `ScreenEnum.NOTIFICATIONS` when you click the bell, you can have the current screen as a non-reactive value.
If you need it to be reactive, you can probably make some other workaround, but I haven't tried.

1683053042,3285,[NV-2168] ✨ Polishing: Fix docs and types for the header,"### 📜 Description

I had to read the source to realize that not only was it possible to use an existing settings component from Novu, but I just needed to accept a `setScreen` callback in the header to use the existing transition in the popup component.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

N/A

### 👍 Expected behavior

- `header` prop of the notification popup should accept a `React.FC<{setScreen: (screen: ScreensEnum)=> void}>` instead of a `()=>JSX.Element`.  Or at least it should have that argument signature.
- Documentation should show all exported components, the meaning of their arguments, and their purpose.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

While you're at it, you might want to look at the performance implications of switching from `{header({setScreen})}` to `<Header {...{setScreen}} />`.  I'm no expert but I think that the current code could cause React to fail to match the header render-to-render, causing unnecessary computation and DOM updates.

This is related to problems which come up in the context of #3246 .

Broken demonstration

### Issue description

I was reading the reference for the Headless API and was experimenting on how each method would behave only to find out some methods doesn't exist in the latest release (v0.13.0) yet is present in the current docs. These are the only methods available on the said version:

Particularly interested on how these other methods would behave exactly since it's ambiguous to me the difference between ""**seen**"" and ""**read**"".

~~On another note, what's the difference between **seen** and **read** exactly?~~ Found the [relevant docs](https://docs.novu.co/platform/step-filter#subscriber-seen--read-filters) now. Have always found this to be very contextual thus the question but I suppose if there's no 2-step, it doesn't matter which one the devs use. Unless the Novu platform does something special behind the scenes? Or are they just simply flags and up to the devs how to use/interpret it?

### Context 🔦

Was gonna try the Vue Component with Nuxt3 but just can't make it work as I'm getting various warnings and errors from multiple attempts to fix the chain of errors. Not to mention, the customizability is limited outside of React (and the Web Component) so went to explore the Headless API instead.

Uncancel cancelled events

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

There are scenarios where an email was cancelled but should be sent after all. Instead of needing to make a new email, it would be nice to be able to change the status of a cancelled event

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Based on `transactionId`, change the status of a triggered event

### 🔄️ Additional Information

To use a mail without storing the transactionId, we calculate a hash of the payload and use that as transactionId. If the payload changes, the original mail is cancelled. However, if the payload is changed back to it's original value, there's no way to send an email with that transactionId again. (Tried POST but this seems to do nothing)

Currently, it's not possible to send a request to a self build API for sending notifications, Novu can get a step of the competition by offering this.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

When relying on services for web push you are limited to their way of working, that's why i'm creating my own. However, i can't send this request to my API currently because it's not possible to install custom integrations.

Using a push webhook, you can create whatever you want.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The best to achieve this is to mess around with the architecture of the Novu push provider base class and allow modularity to what this needs. Mainly, the base function should create a monitor based on the constructor gives, then the extended class would contain many smaller functions that are encapsulated in a larger, main function. This function could use a hash map effect to link commands to the encapsulated functions and call it, depending the on the user's end goal.

1677033318,3257,[NV-2155] 🐛 Bug Report: Intermittent failure to load when visiting multiple feeds simultaneously,"### 📜 Description

I have a feature where I need to show different feeds in different parts of my view.

This is difficult in a couple ways.

I have to have more than one provider to view more than one feed simultaneously.  That's bad ergonomics and I think it's probably related to this bug.
I use the `useNotification` hook to view one feed and the normal notification center popover.  I'd like to use `fetchingStrategy={{fetchNotifications:true}}` for the notifications rendered by my hook, and leave the default in place for my notification center popover.

But sometimes, `isLoading` stays true and `notifications` stays undefined, despite a few renders, when I call `setStore`.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. set up two feeds
2. make a common provider which loads a non-existing feed (to avoid loading anything by default despite the eager fetch) and also defines stores for your first feed.
3. inside the common provider, add a NovuProvider which fetches your second feed.
4. somewhere else inside your first novu provider, use a useNotifications hook

### 👍 Expected behavior

Both feeds should fetch and get pushed to independently --- or better yet, there should be a `useStoreNotifications` hook (or ""storeId"" parameter to various hooks) that meant I didn't have to have multiple providers.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Oftentimes the hook query won't update.

Oddly enough, this has only been causing problems for the outer provider.

If you refetch explicitly, that generally works.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

Manually polling seems to work well as a workaround:
```tsx
  const result = useNotifications() || ({} as INotificationsContext)
  const { setStore, storeId, isLoading, isFetching, refetch } = result
  const timerRef = useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>(null)
  const refetchRef = useRef(refetch)
  refetchRef.current = refetch
  useEffect(() => {
    const start = () => {
      timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        refetchRef.current?.()
        start()
      }, 10000)
    }
    start()
    return () => clearTimeout(timerRef.current)
  })
```
although using `useFetchNotifications` with a `refetchInterval` does not help.  So I'm wondering if this is an issue with the two providers not playing nice with the socket?

That mitigation works without fetching the feed in the other provider or using an initial fetch in the other provider.

1676405464,3255,[NV-2154] 🐛 Bug Report: useFeedUnseenCount shows total feed count,"### 📜 Description

Despite the name and documentation, `useFeedUnseenCount` returns the total count associated with a query.

If you want to fetch the unseen count for a feed, you need to add `seen: false` to the query.

This is a minor annoyance for people who want to keep IStores as constants in some central place.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. send one notification in an empty feed and read it
2. call `useFeedUnseenCount({ query: { feedIdentifier: <feed identifier> } })`
3. call `useFeedUnseenCount({ query: { feedIdentifier: <feed identifier>, seen: false } })`


### 👍 Expected behavior

Something called `useFeedUnseenCount` should count _unseen_ items in a feed.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

If you don't add `seen: false` to the query, you see 1 item instead of the correct 0 in `result.data.count`.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

Since this has hit live, it makes sense to solve in the interim before a major version update with a note on the documentation and ideally in a `/** description */` if it's possible to get that into the `dist/`.

Since this allows functionality that the described behavior doesn't, it probably makes sense to keep the existing hook as `useQueryCount` and export a new `useFeedUnseenCount` as a wrapper.

NotificationBell ignores unseenCount when the context is available.

This is bad because it makes it impossible to use the built in notification bell when you want to change the effective value of unseenCount, e.g. when you want to use different feeds and only ""count"" one of them.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Connect to novu with a NovuProvider
2. Inside the NovuProvider, use a NotificationBell inside PopoverNotificationCenter
3. hardcode a value for unseenCount of NotificationBell.

### 👍 Expected behavior

NotificationBell should honor the count passed to it before looking at context.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The total number of items is the value in context, not the value given.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

In general, the components you have are very useful for getting started, but it would be much nicer if they were designed to allow the user to wrap and change behavior, view, or both.

i.e. instead of using a context for the `header`, `listItem`, etc. props, and having one component calculate all the data and then just render the component in the context if that's provided, it would be nice to expose props and allow higher-order components there.

There's loads of work in the header, for example, and I don't want to have to throw out the whole settings widget and panel just because I want to change the displayed count of items. There's loads of work in the listItem renderer, and I don't want to have to rewrite it all just to conditionally add some react components into the message body.

I'm guessing that the unseenCount was either obsoleted, or designed for unit tests but someone writing the documentation didn't notice.

This is my code snippet that retrieves a wallet address. When I change the wallet, I can obtain a different wallet address.

I am currently utilizing the wallet address as the subscribeId. It works correctly the first time. As you can see, I'm using wallet address for each subscribeId

However, when I change the wallet, the notification payload data does not update based on the new subscribeId. I have checked the onLoad function in NovuProvider and it is only called once.

Additionally, I am using the useNotification() hook function on the CustomNotificationCenter component using the @novu/notification-center library.

1670169316,3211,[NV-2129] 🐛 Bug Report: Notification Center issues (updating different pushes),"### 📜 Description

I think the Notification Center should update instantly for all changes as it should push the the latest state for the feeds state. It should be pushed whenever any feed is added/removed or updated no matter it is an unseen or seen feed. But it seems that it works fine just for unseen feeds, but other feeds are not reflected.
I have attached a screencast that reflects a user on two different browsers, we can assume that it can be two different devices that a user can of course have.
Please see the screencast in attachment.

I'm not sure about the logic for this section in code, but I think at least there should be a hook or trigger initiated and pushed and the user agent can be notified to update the feed state.

or maybe there is already a hook that we can watch in the frontend app.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

please see the following screencast in discord link:
https://discord.com/channels/895029566685462578/1097185860069367850

### 👍 Expected behavior

it should behave the same as for unseen feeds, or at least the better is it should be a trigger to change-to-feeds that can be pushed to the user agent and we can then make a fetch to get the latest feed 

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Similar to how we can override the from email, it would be great if it's also supported to override the sender name, at the moment of triggering the notification

So we can have a dynamic sender name without needing a template variable (which is also not yet supported: #3180). 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

It could be added by a `senderName` property in the `IEmailOverrides`, and also using it if provided to override the sender name with the current from email override.

Specify API-Key and default project when starting self-hosted version of the API. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This is important e.g. for the case in where we want to build IaC of a complete system and need to create a Novu project automatically and the API-Key to be automatically shared between services in the system e.g. pass the key to lambda function environment in AWS or add the key in the automatically created frontend CI pipeline.

For that it is necessary to start e.g. the docker-compose and pass some env variables to specify a project which should be created and their API key.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The API package needs a environment variable to specify a project, its API key and project ID or a way to create these via REST and admin access

1662894967,3180,[NV-2097] 🚀 Feature: Allow sender name to accept dynamic values,"### 🔖 Feature description

The ability to add custom variables to buttons inside email templates, as well as the ability for the sender name to pick up on {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.

Buttons should also accept dynamic variables.



### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This feature should be implemented because it provides more flexibility and customization options for email templates. With the ability to add custom variables to buttons, users can personalize the button text and link URLs based on the recipient's information or behavior. For example, if you want to create a personalized call-to-action button that leads to a specific landing page for each customer, you can use custom variables such as {{FIRST_NAME}} and {{LAST_NAME}} to generate unique URLs for each customer.



### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I'm not a developer

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Additionally, the ability for the sender name to pick up on {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} can help users maintain a consistent branding experience for their email campaigns. For example, if you want to send an email campaign on behalf of your organization, you can use the {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} variable in the sender name field, so that the recipient can easily recognize who the email is from.

I find that Novu is a very powerful tool to centralize providers !
But it makes it as well a riskier place as all the credentials involved are centralized in the Integration Store.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

It avoids displaying secrets and credentials to the Novu console users.
Only the engineer in charge of self-hosting has access to the integration credentials.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Parse template strings sent from the front-end dialog boxes inside the back-end and match them with Novu's environment variables.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried what you can see on the screenshot with the matching variable in my .env file but could not make this work.
I also searched in the Docs and the Github issues, but could not find anything about it.

1659874858,3167,[NV-2074] 🐛 Bug Report: Validation problems,"### 📜 Description

### Unbound length
User can create entities with veery long unpractical names/identifiers. I think we shouldn't allow for names with 88886 length.

### Lack of trim
Basically in every string input (like Organization name) I can ""bypass"" any kind of length validation (even if we fix unbound length issue) by using bunch of whitespaces (whitespace counts as character).

### 👟 Reproduction steps

### Unbound length
1. Generate very long string
2. Paste this string to the input
3. You created entity with veeeery long name

### Lack of trim
1. Type something like `""            ""` in any string input.
4. You created entity with empty name :) 

I consider this as visual bug, because I tried to break application/flow and everything works fine (but just looks weird).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43048524/230771926-67ed188b-655a-4b2f-828b-a46c84e5e432.png)


### 👍 Expected behavior

### Unbound length
I suggest to apply decorators like `@Length(MIN, MAX)` for each DTO. Every input should have defined **practical** boundaries.

Fix can be tricky because it's hard to determine practical length and can break application for existing users (who have for some reason long names/identifiers).

### Lack of trim
I think inputs for things like names and identifiers should be transformed by using `.trim()` String method.

```ts
import { Transform } from 'class-transformer';

export const Trim = () => Transform(({ value }) => value?.trim());
```
We can apply this for each DTO.

Obviously not every string input should be trimmed - I would leave password as it is and fields where whitespace matters (html content, descriptions).

The fix should be implemented carefully, because it can break the application for users who previously created names with leading whitespaces. I will ""think"" about them in my PR.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

## Unbound length
I generated 88886 bytes name.

1655356768,3152,[NV-2059] 🚀 Feature: OneSignal push provider,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently, there is no OneSignal Push provider and therefore Novu is not up to par with the other services while it could be.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

OneSignal offers more functionality to Push Notifications than Expo does, and it should be easy to implement.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The best to achieve this is to mess around with the architecture of the Novu push provider base class and allow modularity to what this needs. Mainly, the base function should create a monitor based on the constructor gives, then the extended class would contain many smaller functions that are encapsulated in a larger, main function. This function could use a hash map effect to link commands to the encapsulated functions and call it, depending the on the user's end goal.

No additional information, apart from I'm already trying to implement this.

1654158020,3142,[NV-2057] 🚀 Feature: Get topics of subscriber,"### 🔖 Feature description

Hi! In our use case it would be helpful to be able to list all subscribers added to a specific topic.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently there is no way to do it. I believe there might be more people who may find it helpful to get such data efficiently.

Another reason is that it will be useful in development. Currently no UI exists where topics are visible so even when you have only 10 topics and each of them has 10 added subscribers it's not very easy to immediately make sure where a specific subscriber belongs.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Currently the `GET /v1/topics` endpoint has 3 optional query parameters:
- `page`
- `pageSize`
- `key` (topic key)

I was thinking about adding another optional query parameter: `subscriberId` which will narrow the results to include only topics which have a provided subscriber added.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Workarounds:
- Listing all topics using `GET /v1/topics` endpoint & aggregate the results which is inefficient
- Implementing custom topic abstraction logic & do not use the one Novu provides

1647480975,3116,[NV-1952] 🚀 Feature: Revokable Client Auth Tokens,"### 🔖 Feature description

Add an expirable, revokable kind of auth token for the client.

Features on par with `django_auth` are ideal.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use case, I want to send notifications to logged-in users.
I don't like HMAC authentication because once a hash is compromised, the attacker can read all of the victim's notifications until the subscriber is deleted. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

- [ ] Add JWTs with a signed expiry and issue date as an alternative to HMAC authentication.
- [ ] Add ""expire this subscriber"" to the App-ID API.
- [ ] Add ""share JWT private key"" to  the App-ID API.
- [ ] Document how to set up the JWT



### 🔄️ Additional Information

It would be nice to be able to avoid an extra roundtrip for login. To do that, an authenticated node/python instance (read: external app server) could share a JWT secret key with the novu server.

Here's how Knock documents the feature I had in mind: https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#authentication-with-enhanced-security

1626289723,3028,[NV-1849] 🚀 Feature: Support for blocks in Slack messages ,"### 🔖 Feature description

Slack has the concept of blocks to build messages - https://api.slack.com/block-kit.

It would be great to make use of these when sending messages to Slack - with interactive elements like buttons and lists.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

So we can send rich messages to Slack.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Allow pasting of blocks into the UI, that then get sent to Slack via the correct API call (and eventually rendered).

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried to use blocks, and they just come through as plain text.

1625539080,3022,[NV-1847] 🐛 Bug Report: Update API accepts null or '' as values but email is not unset,"### 📜 Description

When using something like 

```
channel = await this.novu.subscribers.update(id, {
        email: null,
        phone: data.phoneNumber,
      });
```

Email doesn't change, but request is also not rejected.
      

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1) create subcriber

2) update subscriber with null or empty string

### 👍 Expected behavior

Either disallow null as value, or allow me to unset emails (I highly prefer the second one, as an user could want to stop getting notifications to their email)

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

getting the previous email

1625199765,3019,[NV-1845] 🚀 Feature: Ability to update multiple templates in user preferences,"### 🔖 Feature description

Create new API endpoint(s) PATCH `/v1/subscribers/:subscriberId/preferences` which takes in a payload of format
```
[
  {
     ""templateId"": ""template id"",
     ""preference"": ""UserPreferenceObject""
  }
]
```
This endpoint would apply all of the specified user preferences for each template_id.

Ideally, this should be supported by both the widget controller as well as the core API controller. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently, the API only supports updating user preferences for a single template_id. We would like to set user preferences for many templates in a single API call. The only way to do this right now is to issue an API call per template, which in case there are many templates can overload the API quite a bit. The API should however be capable of optimizing the database operation much better than a bunch of API calls for each template.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Sort of explained in the description and in the ""why the feature is needed""section. However, I don't have the exact technical details of the mongo collections and how to make the batch update work most optimally at hand.

Can we have a section in the docs to put up list of ideas where one can use/integrate Novu in their application?

​I'm asking for both web and mobile applications.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Basic use case will be helping developers to provide ideas where they can integrate features of Novu in their applications. 
This will also clear up the questions like:
- Can I use it in my portfolio or in my small project?
- Can it be used in static web or mobile apps?

and a lot more like this.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I want to a separate page in the documentation website to list out ideas and help folks to use Novu in their projects.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I wanna take up this issue by doing a survey among developers who have used Novu in their applications. This will help me in researching ideas where Novu can be integrated.After that I can put them up on the documentation website.

When a user tries to set tlsOptions for an integration via the UI such as `{ ""rejectUnauthorized"": false }` it seems that it is not written to the DB and is not propagated to the nodemailer integration.

It seems that the NodeMailer config for tls is always set to `undefined` here: https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/4727c8eda6228dea4f4f48c583c081ba292a41a2/providers/nodemailer/src/lib/nodemailer.provider.ts#L58

1. Go to integrations
2. Select Custom SMTP 
3. Set the host, port, `secure=true` and `tlsOptions={ ""rejectUnauthorized"": false }`
4. Click ""save""

### 👍 Expected behavior

1. When the integration is opened again, the `tlsOptions` text field should contain the value that was saved, i.e. it should not be empty
2. The `tlsOptions` should be used in the NodeMailer integration

Currently socket connections that are in subdirectories are no properly initialised in `useInitializeSocket` function.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

If the socket location is anything but `/` it's impossible to connect to a socket with NovuProvider

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

A new prop called `socketPath` that can be passed together with `socketUrl`. By default this path is `/` but in case the socket URL contains a subdirectory then users have the option to add the subdirectory there. Then this `socketPath` can be passed in the `io` init function as a path option.

But later from [v0.11.0](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/releases/tag/v0.11.0), this function has been removed. These prevent us from update to latest version, since we cannot handle close widget popover.

**Edited:**

1615259554,2978,[NV-1819] 🚀 Feature: hash reset tokens to improve security,"### 🔖 Feature description

This is an opinion based issue, but I think it's worth discussing. I have observed that Novu stores reset tokens as plain text in the database. I think hashing reset tokens can increase security in the event of a database breach as accounts with an active reset token will be exposed.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In case of database breach accounts with an active reset token will be exposed. Exposed reset tokens can be used to reset passwords by attackers.


### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

### Reset password request
1. Generate SHA256 hash from generated reset token
2. Store hashed token in database
3. Send to the user plain reset token

### Reset password
1. Take plain reset token from the body
4. Hash reset token with SHA256
5. Use hashed token to query database


### Challenges
It will break tests because we cannot get plain reset token anymore.
```ts
  it('should change a password after reset', async () => {
    const { body } = await session.testAgent.post('/v1/auth/reset/request').send({
      email: session.user.email,
    });

    expect(body.data.success).to.equal(true);
    const foundUser = await userRepository.findById(session.user._id);

    const { body: resetChange } = await session.testAgent.post('/v1/auth/reset').send({
      password: 'ASd3ASD$Fdfdf',
      // resetToken is hashed and test will fail
      token: foundUser.resetToken,
    });

    expect(resetChange.data.token).to.be.ok;

```

### My suggestions
I think it's fine to implement this maybe in repository layer? It's all about storage.

#### Ways to avoid broken tests:
- some kind of field in `UserSchema` like `_plainResetToken` and could be set only in testing environments.
- hash only in production environment?

```ts
export class UserRepository extends BaseRepository<UserDBModel, UserEntity> {
  constructor() {
    super(User, UserEntity);
  }

  private hashResetToken(token: string) {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'prod') {
      return createHash('sha256').update(token).digest('hex');
    }
    // in tests we will be able to obtain plain token
    return token;
  }

  async findUserByToken(token: string) {
    return await this.findOne({
      resetToken: hashResetToken(token),
    });
  }

  async updatePasswordResetToken(userId: string, token: string, resetTokenCount: IUserResetTokenCount) {
    return await this.update(
      {
        _id: userId,
      },
      {
        $set: {
          resetToken: hashResetToken(token),
          resetTokenDate: new Date(),
          resetTokenCount,
        },
      }
    );

I know it's quite rare case but...when you register in Novu using ""Sign in with GitHub"" and later you change GitHub primary email, Novu creates new account and previous data is ""gone"".

Btw. I can reset password while using GitHub provider which is passwordless - it's expected behaviour?

Most applications perform account lookup by id from provider instead just email address. So email change shouldn't affect user experience directly. The main drawback could be stale email address saved in database during registration.

1613057522,2958,[NV-1812] Webhook Provider,"### Why? (Context)

For companies that have legacy delivery systems, novu can trigger an API request with all the information related to the trigger to a webhook URL, the novu customer will be responsible for the actual delivery of the message.

### What?

Implementing a new Webhook provider for each channel type novu has so that the content will still be managed on Novu's side, and instead of calling a provider such as SendGrid, we will perform an API call to the webhook.

### Definition of Done

* Webhook provider for each channel type we have
* Users can specify the webhook URL when sending a message
* Novu will attach an HMAC key with the payload so the user can verify that novu is the initiator of the call
* Novu will retry to call the webhook in case it's down
* A payload will be sent to the webhook to include the information about: notification, subscriber, and trigger payload.

1611917918,2957,[NV-1811] 🚀 Feature: Notification markAs,"### 🔖 Feature description

A way to mark messages that share the same notificationId as seen/unseen and read/unread using the same markAs options that the https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/4177c711c9876177a6ea83d69994769b9ba35e85/apps/api/src/app/subscribers/subscribers.controller.ts#L426 endpoint uses.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Consider the following template and scenario:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090577/223184612-df953a3a-55d5-4c95-9f10-f5862561532f.png)

With the current implementation of Novu in a multi device platform where a user is logged into both a mobile device and a web portal. When a user gets a push notification and opens the mobile app from that push notification the user has technically seen that notification now, but there is no way to mark the `in-app` channel message that links to that notification group as read since they have different messageId's. This would cause the user to still see the same notification as unseen on the web portal even though they have seen the notification on the mobile side via the push notification. This same scenario applies to email as well. 

This feature would allow developers to mark the other messages that share the same `notificationId` (notification message group) as the push notification as seen. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The preferred solution would be to create an endpoint similar to https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/4177c711c9876177a6ea83d69994769b9ba35e85/apps/api/src/app/subscribers/subscribers.controller.ts#L426 and use `notificationId` instead of `messageId`. 

Another solution would be to modify that endpoint to also accept a bool param that would mark the other messages that share the same `notificationId` according to the markAs param. 

The first would be ideal with the second being a ""nice to have"" and would need to make sure that the name of param used is concise enough to tell the user what it does.

Additionally the push notification payload would have to be modified to include the notificationId.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

There isn't a performant way to handle this scenario with the current set of endpoints. One solution is to pull all the messages and loop through them to find the ones that share the same `notificationId` and mark those messages as seen. This solution definitely is not ideal and does not scale.

1609860852,2941,[NV-1804] 🐛 Bug Report: Distributed Lock System Doesn't Work With Redis Password,"### 📜 Description

The distributed lock system does not support Redis passwords like the rest of the app does. This is because [getRedisUrl](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/apps/api/src/app/shared/services/distributed-lock/distributed-lock.service.ts#L12) only uses `process.env.REDIS_HOST` and `process.env.REDIS_PORT`.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Set a Redis password
2. Start the API project

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should allow you to have a Redis password like the rest of the app.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

```text
[ioredis] Unhandled error event: ReplyError: NOAUTH Authentication required.

Version - 0.12.0

The frontend serving app ie. FRONT_BASE_URL makes calls to API_ROOT_URL. 

Issue is, `API_ROOT_URL` variable value doesn't seem to be read from `.env` file, but rather it seems to be hardcoded to localhost.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Fetch the file https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/docker/local/deployment/docker-compose.yml
2. Edit compose file and replace versions 0.11.0 with 0.12.0 (since I wanted to make an upgrade to use new featues)
3. In the same directory, have an `.env` file.
4. for variable `API_ROOT_URL`, try using a different hostname -- other than localhost
5. build image & start containers `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
6. Open `FRONT_BASE_URL` in a browser
7. The frontend serving app (FRONT_BASE_URL) should use localhost for `API_ROOT_URL`. <-- that's the bug.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Expected behavior: API_ROOT_URL value to be read from `.env` file


### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Actual behavior: API_ROOT_URL is being set as localhost, although the value in `.env` is set to my public URL of EC2.

To use the raw JS functionality that drives the Novu in-app notification components.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

As of now, Novu is integrable only through components that hide how Novu works on the browser. But for custom integration where the whole UI should be under the control of the developer and using the SDK for interacting with Novu is not available as of now. This leads to no flexibility on the client-side implementation at all. As an example [Engagespot](https://documentation.engagespot.co/docs/javascript-guide/using-javascript-core-api) provides a core JS SDK . 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

As of #2496 the subscriber stores its locale information, but this isn't used anywhere.

It would be nice to allow localization of the templates, so that a subscriber with a given locale receives notifications in his own locale.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We do have users with multiple languages using the same product, and currently it would not be possible to use the same template for all locales, forcing us to do more in our app than seems necessary.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The template API could allow to specify a default locale for the main template, and alternate versions with the same id but different locales.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

A question left is whereas to match language codes (en, fr, es, ...) to locale codes (en_US, en_GB, fr_BE, es_BR, ...) or not.

It seems we can add more fields about users in Novu DB while identifying as I can see in TS `ISubscriberPayload` interface.
```ts
export interface ISubscriberPayload {
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    email?: string;
    phone?: string;
    avatar?: string;
    locale?: string;
    [key: string]: string | string[] | boolean | number | undefined;
}
```
But it doesn't work as well as expected and just reserved fields would be inserted.
When I retrieve the User in Novu, the custom fields don't retrieve.  for example, we want to use some device information in identifying services such as these props:
- birthday
- isBanned
- registeredAt
- appVersion
- manufacturer
- system
- model
- isAndroid

You may be asking me why? I'll tell you, assume that I want to send a promotion push to every android device by ___manufacturer___ or send a birthday message push to every user that their birthday is on x day. so How can I do this? I used the Novu to manage all these things, not just the system that manages multi providers. Every Marketing team needs this critical feature to communicate or engage more and more with their users.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Try to use custom fields in ```identify``` SDK method.

All custom fields should be added to Novu DB and should be visible in Admin Panel and retrievable by ```getUser``` SDK's method.

1590645103,2835,[NV-1727] 🚀 Feature: A python wrapper for the Novu API,"### 🔖 Feature description

Implementation of a python wrapper to communicate quickly with the Novu API in Python projects

This is not really a feature request as we have already started the implementation, we mainly want to see with you the following issues:

* Do you want to transfer the project to your organization and take over the organization of the project?
* We were using the name ""Novu"" for the client for simplicity, but I think it's wrong. If you want to leave the repository isolated for the moment, we will probably have to see this point (change the name? or make an exemption under conditions?)
* See if you want to warn your python users that an unofficial client exists and that it may be interesting for them to use it

You can take a look at this project right here https://github.com/SpikeeLabs/novu-python. At the time I create this issue, the developments are still being validated by other developers in the alpha branch (and one of them has raised the licensing issue).

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

As part of our Python project (and more specifically our Django microservices), we needed (SpikeeLabs) to implement a client to quickly communicate with your API.

The two main features of this client for us were:

* To be able to import a predefined notification template for our developers to store in each microservice (the microservice itself defines its notification flows)
* To be able to trigger these flows via a trigger.

In this context, I started the implementation of the latter based on:

* The API that you have defined via the openapi.yaml contract (https://api.novu.co/api/)
* Tests directly via Postman to check against reality (the contract has several errors)
* Typescript code reviews for the tricky cases and those I couldn't test myself (push notification for example)

Because I feel it can be useful to everyone, we put it in open source on Github, Pypi, and Readthedocs (not published because still in alpha).


### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The wrapper is built as follows:

* Definition of the objects that the API returns as DTO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object)
* Definition of enumerations via python enumerations
* Definition of wrappers per resource, allowing interaction with the different endpoints of the API

### 🔄️ Additional Information

We also looked at the implementation you had started here https://github.com/novuhq/python/tree/initial-release, but you had several blocks on our side to exploit the latter:

* The project is in an abandoned state for 1 year
* We don't think it's your priority right now

1590627752,2834,[NV-1718] [Roadmap] - Seen/Read Step Filters,"### Why? (Context)

In some cases, there might be a need to filter particular messages if the subscriber has already seen a message for another channel already.

For example, send an in-app message, wait for 1 hour, and skip the e-mail if the user has already seen or read the in-app node.

### What?

Adding a new filter type to filter based on the previous step seen/read the result.

1589781159,2828,[NV-1725] 🚀 Feature: Fetch all triggered events API,"### 🔖 Feature description

I've gone through the API reference and it doesn't seem like there's an API to fetch all triggered events. Because of this, I don't know how to programmatically cancel an event.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

My use case:

When a student books a lesson, we confirm the lesson with the pro. Then, we schedule a lesson reminder email the day before the lesson is set to take place. On occasion, due to weather or other circumstances, the lesson time has to change. However, I don't see an API to fetch all triggered events to be able to cancel that scheduled event. While the cancellation API works great, I'm sure, it's unusable to me right now.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Code sample:

```ts
const novu = new Novu(process.env.NOVU_API_KEY);

// Get all triggeredEvents - likely paginated
const events = await novu.triggeredEvents.fetch();

// Get all triggeredEvents for a given `subscriberId`
const events = await novu.triggeredEvents.fetch({
  subscriberId,
});

// more options/variations
```

1588889763,2817,[NV-1695] [Roadmap] - Decision Trees,"## Why?

Having decision trees in a workflow editor allows users to create branching paths in their workflows. This means that different actions can be taken depending on the outcome of a previous step in the workflow. This can be useful for creating complex, dynamic workflows that can adapt to different scenarios and situations.

## Proposal

Introduce a new node type for a decision tree that based on a condition will branch in two different direction of the workflow.

1. Generate the new React 17 application with the Vite CLI (CRA is not supporting React 17).
2. Install the `@novu/notification-center` package in the React app.
3. Run the app.
4. Open the browser Dev Tools and go to the Sources tab.
5. Find the `@novu/notification-center` package in the `node_modules` folder and open any component.
6. You will see the error saying it couldn't find the sources. 

### Expected Behaviour

It should load the source file content, showing the code.

**The problem**

The source maps are pointing to the TS files but should be pointing to the JS files. Not sure but might be related to that we do generate the TS types to the separate `types` folder and not to the `esm/cjs` folders.

1587514895,2799,[NV-1686] ✨ Polishing: Refactor Topic Subscriptions,"### 📜 Description

I am not sure if this is a polishing task, but anyway...

I was part of a discussion in discord about the topic subscriptions. At the moment it basically works like this:

1. Query all subscribers from a topic and store the results in an array.
2. Run some mapping on these subscribers.
3. Create a new job item for all subscribers in the queue.

This leads to a few problems in my opinion:

* **Increased Latency**: Because you have to wait until all subscribers are queried, the users receive their notification a little bit slower. Might not be a big deal in general.
* **Memory Usage**: All entries are kept in memory, even though it is not needed.
* **Monitoring Issues**: Because a single job item can contain more than one subscriber it is hard to tell how many events need to be processed. It is hard to monitor.
* **Autoscaling Issues**: The pending tasks in a queue is a good indicator for autoscaling, but again, it is hard to tell how full the queue actually is.

What I would do

1. Stream the subscribers, e.g. with RxJS
2. Create one queue job per subscriber.
3. Use batch importing for faster performance.

the change of logic makes to have jobs steps that are unused and we want to manage them properly and not leave them as `pending` as that could either create side effects on other features or skew the statistics.

For that we need to add logic in the trigger event flow to set those job steps that belong to merged digest jobs as digested or merged. That means to create a new StepStatusEnum entry that marks them properly (name to be agreed).

1583338066,2756,[NV-1670] 🐛 Bug Report: Cannot filter steps by custom subscriber data,"### 📜 Description

Hi - first time contributing, so please be gracious! 

I noticed that we're not able to filter event trigger steps by custom subscriber data. In the following screenshot, if a subscriber has custom attributes `{customKey: customValue}` and the event is triggered to them, they will not receive the notification. 

![Screenshot 2023-02-13 at 4 57 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37708620/218610595-1267ad2d-0dcd-4338-8bdc-e9885a02d505.png)


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create a subscriber with custom attributes, eg `""data"": { ""customKey"": ""customValue"" }`
2. Add a step filter to a notification template as the above screenshot
3. Trigger the notification to the subscriber

### 👍 Expected behavior

I expect the app to apply step filters to custom subscriber data. In the scenario described above, a subscriber with matching customKey/customValue pair should receive the notification. 

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

If you add a filter for `data.customKey`, `EQUALS`, `customValue`, and there is a subscriber with `data.customKey: customValue`, that subscriber will not receive a notification from the event. 

![Screenshot 2023-02-13 at 5 06 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37708620/218612330-09af5581-a727-4d69-8024-85fa1a935245.png)

It's not pictured, but the same happens if I use  `customValue` instead of `data.customValue` as the key in the step filter. 

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

I may be missing something since I'm new to this codebase, but it looks like a one-line code change in the `processFilterEquality(variables, fieldFilter, filterProcessingDetails)` function in 
 `api/src/app/events/usecases/trigger-event/message-matcher.service.ts`.

We currently extract the field filter value from the subscriber data using `_.get(variables, [fieldFilter.on, fieldFilter.field])` where 
- `variables` contains the keys: `payload`, `subscriber`, and `webhook` 
- `fieldFilter.on` contains the string value 'subscriber' or 'payload'
- `fieldFilter.field`  contains user input to search by (in the above example, `data.customKey`). 

lodash .get() can iterate through the keys of an object with either a string (eg `""key1[0].key2.key3""`) or with an array (eg `[""key1"", ""0"", ""key2"", ""key3]`). The current implementation uses an array, but since the user passes a string input (eg `""data.customKey""`), we call the function as `_.get( {...}, [""subscriber"", ""data.customKey""] )`, using a mix of array and string values to define the path. It can be fixed if we build a single string for the path (`""subscriber.data.customKey""`) or if we `.split('.')` the field and build an array for the path (`[""subscriber"", ""data"", ""customKey""]`)

Locally, I replaced 
```ts
const actualValue = _.get(variables, [fieldFilter.on, fieldFilter.field]);
```
with 
```ts
const actualValue = _.get(variables, `${fieldFilter.on}.${fieldFilter.field}`);
```
and it works as expected - but I haven't tested it very thoroughly.

When an event is triggered within Novu, the caller will be returned the transaction ID, this ID can be used to access the activity feed which will detail if there were emails sent and what the status of those emails is. If an event was sent to multiple subscribers at the same time, all emails to all subscribers will be returned in the activity feed. We would need to filter out the results based on the subscriberId.

Right now in Jobs table we are storing providerId and that is unnecessary and not used any where else in the code. and this providerId is null for non channel steps(digest etc.) and also there is no guarantee what we stored here is same as what we use while sending message, ex: while creating job if email provider is sendgrid and while sending message if they change email integration to mailgun then in jobs table it shows sendgrid but delivered with mailgun, so it adds confusion and inconsistency, so better remove this from jobs table and also we get some performance boost as we can avoid one DB call to get provider while storing job. 
Please let me know if I missed any use case where we need the jobid?

Currently, it is very difficult to get the embedded notification center to properly align on smaller viewports. With the default settings, when the notification center is opened, it is entirely off-screen and the user has to scroll along the x-axis in order to see it. 

I'm not sure what library is being used to place the notification center when it is opened, but PopperJS (as an example) allows people to specify where the ""popup"" is placed (top/bottom/left/right/top-right etc).

Additionally, being able to override the width of the notification center (ideally by breakpoint) is also something we'd like to be able to use.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

### 👍 Expected behavior

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

I've referenced manually setting the offset as described [here](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/iframe-embed#customizing-the-dropdown-position), however, this doesn't enable me to adjust this based on the size of the screen. It seems to be global. 

I can manually override this by setting this custom CSS in my application:
```
#novu-container {
    left: 0 !important;
 }
```
However, this seems a bit cumbersome, and I'm still struggling to ensure that the notification center is ""full-width"" on the screen, as well.

As demonstrated in this screenshot, where I am manually setting the container to `left:0` for smaller screens, notice how the center is still not filling the screen entirely:
<img width=""1665"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4707908/217977390-3105c17b-6ccd-4613-912a-2edccfa82b92.png"">

In this screenshot, I am using an even-smaller device size, and as you can see, there is no way to properly handle the width of the content within the frame:
<img width=""749"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4707908/217977675-e59c32f5-10ab-42ec-9525-d39e366d3a76.png"">


For context, I am using the iframe embed, but I believe this applies to the other component-based variants as well.

With digest enabled, when triggering messages with payloads with different values for the same digest key, the digests are incorrectly merged.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create a workflow with a digest (can use 30 seconds as backoff and interval values). 
2. Set the digest key to ""test""
3. Trigger multiple messages with payloads `{""test"": ""val1""}` and then `{""test"": ""val2""}` 
4. Digest will be created with the first value but then messages for the 2nd value will be combined and the activity feed will show ""digest combined with existing digest""

### 👍 Expected behavior

When there is a different value for a digest key, the digests should be kept separate.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Digests for different values of the same digest key are combined.

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

When creating a digest, digest key doesn't work when you set the digestKey to `object.name` for example for a payload like `{ ""object"": {""name"": ""test"" }}`.

Other parts of Novu do allow access to a nested payload key so this seems like it should be supported.

Also, if Novu does not find the digest key (like currently if you use a nested key), instead of falling back to simply using the subscriberId as a default, the digest will be turned off entirely.


### 👟 Reproduction steps

Create a digest and specify a nested payload key as the digest key.

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should accept a nested payload key as a digest key

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It allows entering ""object.name"" for example but the digest turns off.

1573460657,2690,[NV-1639] 🚀 Feature: GitOps - Deploy Novu configuration from file-based structure,"### 🔖 Feature description

Some sort of application, such as a node cli tool, that reads a novu configuration file structure from a directory/git repository and deploys it to Novu.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

As your organization grows, managing infrastructure becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming. Using the web UI to make changes in Novu is not an efficient solution, as it can lead to conflicts between multiple teams, make it difficult to test multiple changes in parallel, and require manual replication of changes across different environments.

A GitOps tool that deploys file-based configuration would provide several benefits:
- Improved collaboration between teams, as changes can be managed and reviewed through version control
- The ability to easily test and promote changes in an isolated environment
- Automated, streamlined deployment process, eliminating the need for manual changes in the web UI
- Better visibility into the change management process, making it easier to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.

Overall, adopting a GitOps approach would greatly simplify infrastructure management and ensure consistent, reliable deployment of changes across your environment.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The idea is pretty simple, however the implementation will bring some challenges I'm sure. The CLI tool would scan the chosen directory and look for specific files such as:
- topics
- integrations
- notification templates
- notification groups
- ...

The CLI tool would interpret this content and update the current Novu state to match this configuration, possibly through the existing API calls.

## File structure
An example of the file structure could be:
```
notification-templates/
    my-comment-notification.json
    my-post-notification.json
```
where the json files would include all necessary content to deploy these resources.

## Declarative deploy
This is a declarative deploy, where we define what the state should be and the CLI tool should figure out how to get Novu to that state. The challenge will be to figure out how to make the CLI tool recognize which changes it needs to make to get Novu to this state.

## Environments
As teams will want multiple environments, such as DEV / STAGING / PRODUCTION, you'll need to be able to deploy to different environments as well. Through git, changes can then be promoted to higher environments with a CI/CD workflow.

Environments will also have different environment variables & secrets, for example the DEV & STAGING mailing providers could use a sandbox such as Mailtrap, while the PRODUCTION could use Sendgrid. These environment variables & secrets should be injectable in CI/CD flows.

## Example - Auth0
Auth0 has created a well working tool for their infrastructure that works like this: https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool
An example repository with a configuration for this tool can be found at https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli/tree/master/examples/directory

I tried to add whatsapp as provider but whatsapp workflow is more similar to a SMS than a chat provider.

Related PR https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/1297

To send a message you do this:

```cpp
curl -i -X POST `
  https://graph.facebook.com/v15.0/NumberId/messages `
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' `
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' `
  -d '{ \""messaging_product\"": \""whatsapp\"", \""to\"": \""receiverNumber\"", \""recipient_type\"":\""individual\"", \""type\"": \""text\"", ""text"": { \""preview_url\"": \""false\"", \""body\"":\""Hello World\"" } }'
```

We have 3 important parameters

1. NumberId: This is the sender number ID
2. Authorization Token: No much explanation here, we need this token to send the message
3. We add the receiver phone number in the payload (`to` property)

The rest of the parameters are static

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Current whatsapp implementation as SMS provider https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/1297

### 👍 Expected behavior

The chat provider needs a webhook url which whatsapp do not use, so it's confused to use whatsapp as SMS provider, we will need to update the chat workflow to work similtar to the SMS provider for cases like this

1566925883,2666,[NV-1625] 🚀 Feature: Allow Subscriber to disable all Notifications from a Channel,"### 🔖 Feature description

Possibility for a Subscriber to completely disable all Notifications from a Channel, regardless of Topic or Template.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In our use case, we want to enable all the channels for our users because they can have access to these different channels without wanting to receive notifications on each.

For example, we define in the Template that the Notification is sent on the Discord, Slack, and MS Teams Channels. At this point, the Subscriber can activate MS Teams, Slack, or Discord and disables the others. He will then receive all his notifications through this media and not the 2 others.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The Subscriber will not receive any notification from the Channel if he/she disables the Channel in his/her preferences.

1564171840,2657,[NV-1620] 🐛 Bug Report: Update subscriber preferences expected payload and validation mismatch,"### 📜 Description

Some of our users have reported that the endpoint `PATCH /subscribers/:subscriberId/preferences/:templateId` is not working properly.

The endpoint controller logic ([https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/1297d6115e1450eb5a9085798abd1dd3f028d620/apps/api/src/app/subscribers/subscribers.controller.ts#L304](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/1297d6115e1450eb5a9085798abd1dd3f028d620/apps/api/src/app/subscribers/subscribers.controller.ts#L304)) is expecting a payload in the shape:

```
interface Body {
  channel?: ChannelTypeEnum;
  enabled?: boolean;
}
```

But the validation applied is reused from the Widget module DTO `UpdateSubscriberPreferenceRequestDto`:
[https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/1297d6115e1450eb5a9085798abd1dd3f028d620/apps/api/src/app/widgets/dtos/update-subscriber-preference-request.dto.ts#L12](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/1297d6115e1450eb5a9085798abd1dd3f028d620/apps/api/src/app/widgets/dtos/update-subscriber-preference-request.dto.ts#L12)
There the type assigned to `channel` is `ChannelPreference`.
[https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/2d3050a13b5dfc77b0d66e34ed2eac8a25299631/apps/api/src/app/shared/dtos/channel-preference.ts#L4](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/2d3050a13b5dfc77b0d66e34ed2eac8a25299631/apps/api/src/app/shared/dtos/channel-preference.ts#L4)
Which is expected to be a nested object in the shape of:

```
export class ChannelPreference {
  type: ChannelTypeEnum;
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

### 👟 Reproduction steps

In any environment to do a cURL call to the API.
For example, in local environment:

```
curl -X PATCH \                                                     
 -H ""Authorization: ApiKey <API_KEY>"" \
 -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
 -d '{
      ""channel"": ""email"",
      ""enabled"": true
    }' \
http://localhost:3000/v1/subscribers/1/preferences/1
```

This will raise an error:

```
{""statusCode"":400,""message"":[""nested property channel must be either object or array""],""error"":""Bad Request""}%
```

### 👍 Expected behavior

Update the controller to satisfy the validation and follow the same structure as in the Widget module.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

\--

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

Test suite for update subscriber preferences is applying a different payload (the one used in Widget module). This means the tests are not accurate. Also we are not checking if the values are updated properly.
We need to increase the test suite robustness to be able to catch these bugs.

1564149599,2656,[NV-1619] 🚀 Feature: Notification categories/severity/labels ,"### 🔖 Feature description

You should add more metadata options to make notification templates more configurable. Stuff like categories, labels or severity would make templates and notifications hold more information and it could extend Novu functionality. Users could choose their preferences based on these labels (e.g. send WARNING notifications by email and INFO in-app).

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We wanted to use Novu as our notification backend while wrapping the API to serve our own component, we found the notification/workflow/template model lacking, especially when we needed to categorize the notifications into specific categories and label them accordingly. More metadata options or extended template model would help.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

- extend notification model with more metadata

1562612637,2644,[NV-1615] 🚀 Feature: FCM platform specific parameters,"### 🔖 Feature description

The current implementation of the FCM provider only uses the `notification` and `data` fields. To create responsive mobile applications we also need to be able to access the `android` and `apns` fields. I propose to add this in the overrides parameters.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This allows Novu to also be used for push notifications that redirect to specific pages with more relevant information within mobile apps instead of generic home pages.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Forking the project and implementing the necessary changes. The steps I want to take are the following:
- extract the `android` field from the overrides parameter and add it to the request to FCM
- extract the `apns` field from the overrides parameter and add it to the request to FCM (apns.payload.apn)
- ensure these elements reach FCM through testing
- ensure these properties have no side effect in other fields
- ensure they can also be set independently and alongside one another

1561158293,2636,[NV-1598] 🐛 Bug Report: Template variables are given a default empty string value even when nothing is entered in the default value form,"### 📜 Description

When creating a template, even when you do not set a default variable, the value is set to an empty string.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Create a template and use a variable named `testVar` but do not enter a default value. Send  `testVar` in your payload as null or undefined.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Novu should not overwrite with an empty string if there is no default value set. 

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

 Note that when inspecting the  ""payload"" in the activity feed Novu will have sent an empty string as a default value for `testVar`. 

You can also check by getting the template from the API and seeing this in the variables:

1559590008,2628,[NV-1593] 🚀 Feature: sending daily digest at a fixed time,"### 🔖 Feature description

A use case I'm interested in is sending users a daily digest email, containing the notifications of the previous day at a specific time of day.


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my specific use case, we are creating a task system. In out system, several events would happen (colleague assigns user to a task, a task the user is subscribed to gets completed, etc.) that can trigger notifications. A daily digest like this would allow users to get an email containing an overview of things that happened the day before, so they can quickly check whether they missed anything, and see what they need to do next. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

As I understand it, the current digest system starts ""collecting"" notifications when the first notification happens, and sends the notification after a configurable amount of hours/days. 

In the use case I describe, the system would start ""collecting"" notifications based on an interval in a schedule (cron job would be perfect for this I think). At the next interval, the collected notifications get sent to the user (just like in the digest), and the collected notifications get reset. At which point the system will start collecting for the next interval.

Concretely, an example of some cycles would look like this:
Let's assume we have configured the interval to be daily, and the daily digest to be sent at 8:00.

- system starts collecting notifications on monday at 8:00
- on monday. notifications A and B come in at 13:00 and at 15:00
- on tuesday 8:00, the daily digest of notifications A and B is sent to the user, the system starts collecting again
- on tuesday, no notifications happen
- on wednesday 8:00, no digest is sent, since no notifications happened.  The system starts collecting again
- on wednesday, nofications C and D come in at 12:00 and 16:00
- on thursday 8:00 the daily digest of notifications C and D is sent to the user, the system starts collecting again
- ...

### 🔄️ Additional Information

From what I can gather from the docs, a fixed time delay (collect notifications for n minutes/hours, send afterwards), and fixed date (send at configured datetime x) are supported, but the use case I describe here is not supported.

I asked about this functionality on the discord in [this](https://discord.com/channels/895029566685462578/1064574173915136012) thread, @nevo-david (I hope I'm tagging the correct user here) mentioned it is not supported yet.

Ideas for later versions of this feature:
- the schedule for the digest (daily/weekly) can be configured by the user
- we can configure this feature to filter out notifications that have already been read by the user

1558420154,2624,[NV-1592] 🚀 Feature: New design proposal for Novu Starting providers ,"### 🔖 Feature description

While working on other bugs I come across Novu starting email provider code and felt like this is adding extra complexity(some performance overhead) for main line of code multiple places(api, web etc.)..  and if we make any changes to main line of code we need to make sure this additional code not causing any issues and same way any modifications to this extra code not causing issues to main line. and later if we extend this to SMS, Chat etc. then it may add more complexity.. Another problem is these emails are stored as sendgrid emails, later if they use their own sendgrid provider then both stored as sendgrid provider.

I feel we can implement this logic with out effecting main line of code and simpler and more flexible way, I would like to present new approach for brainstorming, feel free to point out mistakes/shortcomings.

Here is the new design I propose:
We ca create new provider that can extend Sendgrid(or implement completely from scratch)  and when user enables this provider they simply provide preferred sender name in the UI(so not limited to organization name), apikey and from address we can read from environment, so user cant override these values, if they want to give different reply-to address then they can give in UI, so the replies goes to their email instead of coming to no-reply@novu.co .
And this is like any other provider, so if they don't have any email provider enabled then only they can enable this, and coming to count and limit logic, this can be implemented specific to this provider but I feel we can promote this to main line and expose this like feature for users, this will be very useful for organizations, they can set limits and track counts control their budgets, in case of attacks also this limit can help to mitigate the risk of getting big bill, so for all active providers we can expose this, not just start provider. if we need to extend this to SMS, CHAT, PUSH etc. also simple, just adding another provider. And later if we plan to start charging beyond free usage then we can do so..
I feel this is much cleaner approach as it is extending our system naturally(by adding new providers with out modifying main line code), feel free to point out if any mistakes in this approach or missed any edge cases.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Simplify the free provider logic.

As engineers, who created Novu, you might have a better context and point me in the right direction. It seems to be related to the [indexing mechanism difference between native MongoDB and CosmosDB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56988743/using-the-sort-cursor-method-without-the-default-indexing-policy-in-azure-cosm). Is there anything, what can be improved on the Novu side to make it run there?

1553444615,2577,[NV-1568] 🐛 Bug Report: Wrong providerId stored in jobs collection,"### 📜 Description

When you enable multiple integrations(say discord and sendgrid) then for all jobs it is storing discord as providerId, even for email jobs. Another problem is for delay and digest jobs also storing same providerId(in this case discord).


### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Create 2 integrations discord and sendgrid
2. Create an email notification 
3. Trigger the email notification created above and observe the jobs table, it is storing providerId as discord.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Expected to store sendgrid as providerId in jobs table

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Storing wrong providerId discord in jobs table

### 🤖 Node Version

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

The problem is with this line:
channelType: ChannelTypeEnum[step.template.type] in src/app/events/usecases/process-subscriber/process-subscriber.usecase.ts
The problem here is using StepTypeEnum values doing reverse lookup in ChannelTypeEnum and that is always returning undefined as string enums does not support reverse lookup. 
Possible fix: we can step.template.type to upper case and /or  change both enums values to upper case.
This fix make sure to record providers for all channels but we still have problem with delay and digest steps, there also it stores one of these providers as providerId, I believe it should store null for those steps? for that we need to add additional logic to skip providerid for those steps?

We’re trying to send a broadcast to all our subscribers which includes an apostrphe in the text.

This is seemingly converted into unicode characters somewhere along the line and prior, to using Novu we just used Twilio directly and things seemed to send fine through there API. 

Could Novu be replacing the apostrophe with a unicode character causing our messages to come across funny to users?

Not convert the apostrohpe to unicode and send that unicode in the SMS

1550903036,2561,[NV-1557] 🚀 Feature: Allow pagination handling in refetch method,"### 🔖 Feature description

A way of selecting a number of pages to refetch in novu-notification-center's `refetch` method.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I would like to be able to refetch the user's paginated notifications on the specific page they were prior to the refetch action.

Example: When a user has multiple unseen notifications and triggers a `markAsSeen` method in a notification situated in a page different than 0 in the pagination, a `refetch` method is called to update the notifications array and confirm to the user that the notification was indeed marked as seen. But the refetch method resets the page to 0 and, to view that single notification, they would have to load possibly multiple pages. If there was a way to inform the refetch method of how many pages to load at once, the user would likely not even notice the reload, and would be able to keep viewing the notifications from that point on.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I would like to be able to pass a number of pages to refetch as a parameter in the `refetch` method.

Implementation (using Typescript):
```typescript
function refetch({ page: number }) {
  // Refetches on desired page
}
```

Usage (using React and Typescript):
```jsx

const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);

function handleLoadMore() {
  if(hasNextPage) {
    fetchNextPage();
    setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);
  }
}

function handleMarkAsSeen(notificationId: string) {
  markAsSeen(notificationId);
  refetch({ page: currentPage });
}
```

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried manually fetching the pages after the refetch, but calling the fetchNextPage method multiple times in a short period of time caused some wrong behaviors, such as not loading all the desired pages and missing notifications. And even if those behaviors did not happen, calling a fetch method to an API multiple times in a row isn't performatic at all.

Add environment variables, so Redis client can be used with sentinels in configuration. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We use Redis cluster and we would like to connect Novu to it. We have multiple hosts while Novu only supports single host address in REDIS_HOST environment variable.
Our connection string:
`redis+sentinel://redis-0,redis-1,redis-2/master/15`

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

As I was reading through the code, both `ioredis` and `bull`  support this feature. 
I would add 2 new env vars:

- REDIS_USE_SENTINELS: (true/false)
- REDIS_SENTINELS: redis1,redis2,redis3

and rework how Redis/Bull client is initialized

alternatively, a more sophisticated solution would be to add `REDIS_URI` env variable that parses and overrides other redis configuration - host, port, db_index...
REDIS_URI: `redis+sentinel://redis-0:2000,redis-1:3000,redis-2:4000/master/15`

Novu should allow for images uploaded (such as the branding logo) to be served from a CDN rather than just the endpoint that it was uploaded to.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Serving content such as logos from a CDN can significantly reduce load on origin S3 buckets.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

This can be a very simple addition. All one would need is the optional environment variable `CDN_URL`, at which point the storage service would return either the URL of the image on the CDN or the path it was uploaded to if `CDN_URL` is not set.

1535313911,2510,🐛/:rocket: Bug Report/Feature Request: Support Minio's S3 Compatible API,"### 📜 Description

When Novu attempts to create a signed URL to upload a file to Minio (tested in a local environment) Minio will say that the `SignatureDoesNotMatch`. 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Download Minio (<https://min.io/>), then use the command `MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password minio server ~/.cache/minio --address localhost:4566 --console-address localhost:9000` to run Minio on the same port that localstack would use.
2. Log into the admin console at <http://localhost:9000> with the credentials set as env variables, or the defaults.
3. Create a bucket with the desired name, and set the equivalent in the `.env` file.
4. Generate access keys, and add those to the `.env` file as well. Don't forget to set match the AWS region in the settings panel of Minio with your `.env` file, otherwise the signature definitely will not match.
5. Run Novu, and note the `403` server response to attempts at uploading an image to the S3 instance in the settings page.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Minio should respond in the same way as any other S3-compatible storage system, such as LocalStack.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Congratulations on topics 🤩, but I think it would be better to have builder pattern under the hood of topics and other API's, and use push and pop of Mongodb instead of fully updating. If you want to add a new user to a topic, you don't have to send the rest of the data constantly. Also it will reduce load to the API.

before:
```typescript
const response = await novu.topics.addSubscribers(topicKey, {
  subscribers: ['subscriber-id-1', 'subscriber-id-2', ...],
});
``` 
after:
```typescript
const responseAdd = await novu.topics.get(topicKey).subscribers.add('subscriber-id-1');
const responseRemove = await novu.topics.get(topicKey).subscribers.remove('subscriber-id-1');
const responseList = await novu.topics.get(topicKey).subscribers.list();
``` 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

if User join's to the topic it's better to just add the user, instead of retrieve all the data and send it back with additional user.
Reduce API load.

1532781566,2500,[NV-1507] 🚀 Feature: User Preference By Topic,"### 🔖 Feature description

It would be great if we can get the user to subscribe and unsubscribe from receiving certain notifications based on some category.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

My product has different features (you can think of them as sub-products). Users may be interested in receiving notifications that fit a certain category while unsubscribing from those that are not of interest to them. That way you can get the user to declare what type of notifications they would like to receive without forcing them to subscribe or unsubscribe to every notification one by one. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Similar to how a subscriber has a notification preference per channel, we can benefit from adding a list of categories the user has unsubscribed to. Whenever the an event is triggered via the API, the request would be immediately muted and not sent if the notification falls under the category the user has unsubscribed to.

This is different from the Topics feature that is being released in v0.10 (which honestly probably is better called subscriberGroups or something). But the exciting part is that the feature that I am describing can be very complimentary to one another. The code that triggers the API can describe what type of user groups (i.e Topic in Novu lingo) is triggered and then a subset of those users will received the message depending on their preference.

Add a new masked value returned by the API, and the client could only see the masked value and not the whole content of it. The user could only replace the whole string or just parts of it.

1530312353,2481,[NV-1515] 🐛 Bug Report: Multichannel for Push notifications doesn't work for some cases,"### 📜 Description

Novu allows users to have multiple providers for Push notifications active at the same time (i.e. FCM and APNS). However, this fails in specific cases. While it is supported during the first time someone will configure them, it seems that is fails for future updates.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Connect to both FCM and APNS
2. Check that they are both active
3. Disable FCM
4. Check that only APNS is active
5. Enable FCM again
6. APNS gets disabled

### 👍 Expected behavior

Multiple providers should be allowed.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

When enabling FCM, APNS gets automatically disabled.

Add a new project under `/examples` to demonstrate how to use Novu with the latest Next.js (v13). Perhaps, another one strictly with React.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

To start off, it's something that I believe is just something good to have.

Previously, the Vue and Angular examples only demonstrated the client-side stuffs (notification center components in particular). Next, being as awesome as it is, would allow us to demonstrate how to use the notification center package for React + demonstrate how to use the @novu/node package as well using Next's API routes.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

So here's the plan:

- The usual frontend demo on the Notification Center for React (@novu/notification-center).
- An API endpoint `/api/hello` that triggers a notification template.
- The README for the project setup would also have this bonus step on how to set up a Notification Template for he 2nd step (another win 🥳)

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I already have something prepared, here's a screencast on how it works. It's based on the default Next.js 13 starter.

1522623209,2442,"""Subscriber does not have a configured channel"" when attempting to deliver a web push notification","I am submitting a question about how to use Novu in combination with Firebase Cloud Messaging for web browser push notifications.

Hi,
I am using Novu to deliver notifications to the users of my app. In the app, I have a process to sync the users with Novu so that the subscriber list is always up to date whenever my users update or change.

I am interested in delivering web browser push notification to my users, so I have created a notification template and in its workflow I have added a Push step.

I have read through the Novu documentation so I know that in order to deliver push notifications to users, I need to have a provider with the push delivery capability; to my knowledge Novu itself doesn't have the ability to display web notifications. I have selected Firebase Cloud Messaging as the web push notification provider.

In addition to this, I am aware that each subscriber must have an FCM token set as its credential in Novu. I _think_ the way it works is that while Novu does all of the notification triggering and distributing to the providers, the ultimate web notification display is handled by Firebase.

So, if I understand correctly, in my project I need to add the Firebase SDK, generate the FCM token using its APIs, call Novu to tell it the subscriber's FCM token credential is that token and then if I were to use Novu to trigger a notification, it would contact Firebase to tell it to deliver the notification to a subscriber with the given ID and FCM token and the Firebase web SDK in my web app would take care of the notification reception and display.

For a proof of concept, this is how I am getting the FCM token and passing it to Novu as the subscriber credential:
```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getMessaging, getToken } from 'firebase/messaging'; 

// Note that there is also a required SW at `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
async function installFirebase() {
  // Remove the global single click handler so it never fires ever again
  document.body.removeEventListener('click', installFirebase, true);

  // See https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/…/settings/general
  // Scroll down to Web Apps to find this snippet
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: ""…"",
    authDomain: ""…"",
    projectId: ""…"",
    storageBucket: ""…"",
    messagingSenderId: ""…"",
    appId: ""…""
  };

  // See https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup
  initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

  // See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client#configure_web_credentials_in_your_app
  // See https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/…/settings/cloudmessaging
  // Scroll down to Web Configuration to find the VAPID key
  const token = await getToken(getMessaging(), { vapidKey: '…' });

  // This calls the Novu API to set the subscriber credential to the FCM token
  await setSubscriberCredentialWithFcmToken(token);
}

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  // Run the Firebase installation in response to a user gesture to achieve
  // transient activation required for `Notification.requestPermission` used
  // internally by `getToken`
  useEffect(() => document.body.addEventListener('click', installFirebase, true), []);
  …
}
```

This code snippet runs and produces a correct-looking FCM token. I don't think Novu has an API to be able to read out the subscribers credentials back to make sure it got stored to the subscriber correctly, but it does have an API to get the subscriber metadata and every time I call the API to set the subscriber credentials, I see the subscriber's `updatedAt` is bumped, so I am reasonably sure the FCM token is being saved to the subscriber.

However, when I go to the notification workflow and I run a workflow test, passing in the correct subscriber ID (the same used to store the subscriber credential to), I get this error for the Push step:

> Subscriber does not have a configured channel

I searched through the Novu GitHub issues and I have not found any references to this error.

What does this error mean and how can I fix it?",,

 WARN  deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues.

Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.

1518994590,2424,[NV-1517] 🚀 Feature: Topic filtration,"### 🔖 Feature description

```
await novu.trigger('<REPLACE_WITH_EVENT_NAME_FROM_ADMIN_PANEL>', {
  to: [{ type: TriggerRecipientsTypeEnum.TOPIC, topicKey: topicKey }],
  payload: {
    ""NOT"": [""a"",""b""]
  },
});
```

based on this, the topic is now sent to all subscribed users. topic filtration rule could have some option to send topic to all EXCEPT \[""a"", ""b""\]

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

its needed when you need to manipulate topic

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Topic filtration for my usecase below. Its simple exclude which is needed for my app to do notifications correctly.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

my usecase is about comments: when comment is sent, it has to be verified by owner of post.. if its verified, then i wanted the topic usecase.. dont send the notification to owner of post and send special notification to owner of comment and then send notification to all except owner of post and owner of comment (since new comment would not be clear for owner of comment and owner of post knows there is new comment, since its verified)

or another usecase: When owner of post comments on a post, it will send out notification to everyone subscribed.
Owner is subscribed too to see new comments from other people. The owner should then NOT get push notification about his comment.

1517706127,2421,[NV-1423] 🚀 Feature: Vue 2 support in the vue-notification-center package,"### 🔖 Feature description

Add support for the Vue 2 in the `vue-notification-center` package.

This was requested on the Discord and could be a quick win for us: https://discord.com/channels/895029566685462578/937309213036785744/1059265218368245860

Suggestion from @florian-lefebvre:
It should be easy to implement with this library: https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi

The person who will be working on this should verify if it works with both Vue 2 and Vue 3, we do have an example Vue 3 app in the repo, please make sure that it still works there.


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

It will allow the companies that develop their apps with Vue 2 to use the Notification Center much more effortlessly.

Using this lib: https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi

1512520295,2378,[NV-1405] Add copy functionality for vars in variable manager.,"v0.10.0 released our new variable manager (currently implemented only in email editor) there we expose more information about variables that are available for our novu users. Especially about our system variables such as digest related vars, information about subscribers etc.

To make the use even easier, we would like to make a click on the var copy it to the user's clipboard so all he has to do is paste and use.

For example:

![Screen Shot 2022-12-28 at 9.32.45.png](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/14c5f7fb-b734-4167-88c2-a6898b51da2d/99e4b479-97f2-4cbb-8960-a572c6b5ab0c)

A hover on firstName will show a copy icon, a click will copy to clipboard  `subscriber.firstName`

Please notice:

* Should copy the whole variable path.
* Should apply to both 'System Variables' and 'Step Variables'.

Extra Information:

* The wrapping component is [VariablesManagement.tsx](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/apps/web/src/components/templates/email-editor/variables-management/VariablesManagement.tsx).
* <Copy /> should be imported from `/design-system/icons `
* To see an existing example of copy to clipboard you could take a look at [NotificationSettingsForm.tsx](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/apps/web/src/components/templates/notification-setting-form/NotificationSettingsForm.tsx#L115). We recommend the use of Mantine's [useClipboard](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-clipboard/) hook.

NOTICE: this is a system-wide issues that does not relate to a specific screen but rather to all screens. When testing the solution make sure to test for dark-light theme, and different kinds of toasts / props.

You probably do not need to  touch the intercom component at all, and focus on the Novu prop only.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

NA

### 👍 Expected behavior

We should have an ENUM for routes that can be used as constant, this will used at all places where we are using route,
For example - 
`navigate(<path>)`

It will improve reusability and less error-prone code.

For example, we can save ourselves from spelling mistakes, if in future if we decide to rename routes it will be easier.

> }

The configuration for the APNS provider in Novu requires: 

> Private Key
> Key ID
> Team ID

After searching in Google, I found out that the `topic` is actually the `bundleId`. Other apps that provide APNS testing requires that (bundleid/topic) to be set together with the rest of the parameters (private key, keyid, teamid) before setting the payload and sending the notification.

I'm not familiar with APNS, so I'm not sure if my assumption is correct but I tried placing this parameter in payload and overrides objects without any luck.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Configure APNS provider
2. Send push notification using APNS

### 👍 Expected behavior

Push notification should be sent.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

The following error occurs:

> {

```
/novu/providers/apns/src/lib/apns.provider.ts

```

However, it seems that the actual prod value is `prod`.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Sending a push notification using APNS in production environment will probably fail. I'm having some issues with it but I don't know if it's due to that yet.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Novu's production parameter should me `prod` and not `production`.

Probably something like: `production: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'prod'`

`production: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' `check is wrong.

1507444973,2341,[NV-1529] 🐛 Bug Report: APNS private key is not being parsed correctly ,"### 📜 Description

In APNS provider there is a field in order to set the `private key`. However, it seems that if someone copies the key and places it in that specific field, it's not getting parsed correctly and as a result, an error occurs when trying to send a notification.

> }

NOTE:
******The private key is being set correctly if you update the provider using the API `/v1/integrations/{providerId}` and manually set the key in the request body with a valid format.**

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Copy the APNS private key
2. Enter it in the `private key` field
3. Enter the other values (key id, team id) and activate the provider
4. Send a push notification using APNS

### 👍 Expected behavior

Push notification should be sent.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

> }

The format of the key normally is the following:

> -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
> aaaaaaaaaaaa
> bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
> cccccccccccccccc
> dddddddd
> -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

After setting it in the dashboard like I described above, the /v1/integrations API returns:

> -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- aaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccccccccc dddddddd -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

It seems that it replaces the `\n` with `whitespaces`.

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **titenkov** December  5, 2022</sup>
Hi,

I haven't found the answer anywhere in the docs, so decided to trigger the discussion here: what is the expected way of localizing the notification templates? There is information about localizing the widget itself, but not the actual messages. I expect that the data is stored separately from the notification templates, so wondering if you have the localization of templates available in Novu.

It would be great if you can point me to the right place in the documentation or some example.

Thanks :)</div>

1499624778,2299,🚀 Feature: pull request preview environments to improve maintainer productivity,"### 🔖 Feature description

I would like to support novu by implementing [Uffizzi](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi) preview environments.
Disclaimer: I work on the Uffizzi project.

Uffizzi is an open-source, full-stack previews engine. The platform is available completely free for novu (and all open-source projects). 


### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This will provide maintainers with preview environments of every PR in the cloud, which enables faster iterations and reduces time to merge. You can see the open-source repos which are currently using Uffizzi over [here](https://uffizzi.notion.site/).

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Create an initial PoC

Uffizzi is purpose-built for the task of previewing PRs, and it integrates with your GitHub Actions workflow to deploy preview environments in the background without any manual steps for maintainers or contributors. 

### 🔄️ Additional Information

We can go ahead and create an initial PoC for you right away if you think there is value in this proposal.

1498526353,2291,🚀 Feature: Reusable layout (template),"### 🔖 Feature description

Add reusable layouts that can be used to make templating less repetitive and easier to maintain (not having to edit all templates when something, like a company phone number, changes.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In many cases, especially for e-mail, you re-use many components in an e-mail. While having access to MJML (https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/1792) would help. It still leaves us with repetitive work to recreate headers and footers for each template. Postmark solves this issues by allowing users to define a 'layout' that contains a placeholder `{{{ @content }}}`, which can then be used when creating a template. The contents of the template will be replace the `{{{ @content }}}` placeholder.

https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1077-template-syntax

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Add a section ""Layouts"" in ""Settings"" in which one (or more) layouts can be created. Layouts can then be used when creating templates. When a layout is used, the contents of the template are placed in the layout using the `{{{ @content }}}` placeholder.

1484280345,2233,🚀/🐛 Feature/Bug: No possibility of sending FCM data payload,"### 🔖 Feature description

Dear all

With the commit `8c30377ddd806d4c06d51ba4f9ee6541ab593e38` there was the introduction of the new FCM API, where novu uses now `sendMulticast`.

I'd like to send some payload data to handle clicks on push notifications, i.e. I want to use the `data` property for a received push notification. 

In `fcm.provider.ts`, there's this:

```typescript
  async sendMessage(
    options: IPushOptions
  ): Promise<ISendMessageSuccessResponse> {
    delete (options.overrides as any)?.deviceTokens;
    const res = await this.messaging.sendMulticast({
      tokens: options.target,
      notification: {
        title: options.title,
        body: options.content,
        ...options.overrides,
      },
    });
```

So, Novu only uses the `notification` property of the `MulticastMessage`, which is an extension of the a [BaseMessage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.messaging.basemessage.md#basemessage_interface). The `BaseMessage` also allows for a `data` property, which then can be accessed when the notification is received. 

Be aware, that just using `payload` as the `data` property might be an issue, since payload can be of any type, e.g. `payload : { someList : [] }` would fail, because the `data` property must be `{ [key: string]: string; }` according to the docs.

Now, I would do and push this feature myself but sadly I'm not experienced enough with JS to build the application... 

Thanks!



### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

To act according to the received data when clicking on a received FCM push notification, e.g. show a different screen than usual etc.

1480840288,2217,🚀 Feature: Inherit `fontFamily` when using `PopoverNotificationCenter`,"### 🔖 Feature description

Remove any references to `fontFamily` from `PopoverNotificationCenter` and its `children`, allowing the component to inherit from existing styles.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

When adding `PopoverNotificationCenter` to an application, it's highly likely that inheriting the font from the global styles is desirable. Furthermore, it's currently too difficult to customize the `fontFamily`, leading to situations where the UI displays mixed fonts.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

@scopsy mentioned that the current implementation is ""mostly for the widget component implementation that lived in the iframe"" and that it should be possible to move the reference ""inside the iframe embed config"".

Recently we introduced an easy way to add translations for the `@novu/notification-center` component interface. So you can either specify a translation object or pass a premade translation. Read more about it on the [docs](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/react-components#customize-the-ui-language). 

## How?

* Add a new translation file here: `packages/notification-center/src/i18n/languages`. You can follow the `en.ts` example.
* Add your translation import to the `TRANSLATIONS` object at `packages/notification-center/src/i18n/lang.ts` 
* Add the language code to `I18NLanguage` type at `lang.ts` file.
* Submit a PR :)

1476949216,2206,[NV-586] Mark all as read,"**What this is about:**

In our notification center, we want to indicate when a notification is read or seen. This is the notification center:

![CleanShot 2022-07-28 at 13.55.42@2x.png](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/a96fbcfc-d495-4b33-9a05-f3158821ca57/b1129687-24e4-4e4c-a2e6-4de37701ab9a)

**Challenge:**

When users receive a large amount of notifications it’s hard to mark all of them manually as seen/read, a common UX behavior is to have a “mark all as seen” functionality. 

**Solution:**

Have a `Mark All as Read` button. Here is the wireframes and design will be added by @shlomtzyk 

**Scope of work and edge cases:**

* When there are no notifications - disable the button.
* This ticket relates to read / unread and read all - seen and not seen are not in scope.
* Update the badge with the correct number of unread.

**Design:**

1476949201,2202,[NV-822] Flaky widget test for update realtime notifications,"## What?

Recently looks like the `should update real time for new notifications` test in `apps/widget` fails with the following assertion:

```
 1) Notifications List
       should update real time for new notifications:

      AssertionError: Timed out retrying after 4000ms: Not enough elements found. Found '7', expected '8'.
      + expected - actual

      -7
      +8
```

Re-running this test usually solves the problem. 

Looks like it's some sort of a race condition with the socket or updating sequence. 

My suspect is the following file: `packages/notification-center/src/components/novu-provider/NovuProvider.tsx`

Where the following code:

```
function UnseenProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { unseenCount, setUnseenCount } = useUnseenController();
  const { socket } = useSocket();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (socket) {
      socket.on('unseen_count_changed', (onData: { unseenCount: number }) => {
        if (!isNaN(onData?.unseenCount)) {
          setUnseenCount(onData.unseenCount);
        }
      });
    }

    return () => {
      if (socket) {
        socket.off('unseen_count_changed');
      }
    };
  }, [socket]);

  return <UnseenCountContext.Provider value={{ unseenCount, setUnseenCount }}>{children}</UnseenCountContext.Provider>;
}
```

Get's the events out of order, 7 is coming after the 8 update.

1476949108,2186,[NV-24] Tabs - Horizontal Menu,"## **Why?**

We are in the process of creating our new core components using [mantine](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) and creating our very own [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for easier UI development.

To learn more about our design system see [#219](https://github.com/notifirehq/notifire/issues/219)

## **How?**

To start contributing you need to run storybook locally:

```
npm run setup:project
cd apps/web 
npm run storybook
```

To contribute, add a new component directory named `Tabs` in `apps/web/src/design-system/` with the following files:

1\. Component file, overriding Mantine’s default implementation based on the design below.

2\. Styles implementation, to fit our design. Consider dark and light color scheme.

3\. Create a story for the tabs component, showcasing our designs options.

### **Tabs designs**

1472131631,2153,🚀 Feature: Azure Active Directory Authentication,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently, there are two ways to login. You have the GitHub OAuth 2 provider, and then you have your standard username password configuration. 

I would like to propose an additional login method utilizing Azure Active Directory.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Allowing users to authenticate with Azure Active Directory could aid in the adoption of Novu with Microsoft heavy companies.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

There will need to be the addition of the following env vars
(note: AAD is the standard abbreviation for Azure Active Directory)
```
AAD_CLIENT_ID
AAD_CLIENT_SECRET
````
**Route: `/v1/auth/aad`**
Would check to see if the env vars are set. Like it does here for [GitHub](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/f4d630b6de7df2772ed6a7fec8dd4be94ec6b450/apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts#L61)

Exchange the code for a token, reach out to the Microsoft Graph and get the user details and store it in the database layer.

The styling of the React Notification Center Settings screen is off. There are customisation options for the component, but our expectation was that there is a basic styling applied by default. Hence this issue to find out if this is expected behaviour, missing config, or a bug.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Add the Notification Center component into a react app. We are using nextjs with tailwind.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Have a decent default styling.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Note: IMO in order to achieve that we need to create hook useUnreadCount same as the useUnseenCount that will store the readCount under context using the socket connection (the API part is already implemented therefore when a new notification fires the socket should get the update - the only thing that remains is to listen to unread_count_changed event), or create a general hook that will store them both.

1464372662,2094,💭 Idea: feed.context.ts should return empty object instead of null,"### 🔖 Feature description

As it currently stands, `feed.context.ts` located [here](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/2d3050a13b5dfc77b0d66e34ed2eac8a25299631/packages/notification-center/src/store/feed.context.ts#L10) is returning a null value by default. 

This can throw a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'activeTabStoreId')` on the Notifications Center if it's not yet unitized. After speaking with David and Pablo, it was thought that a change to an empty array would serve better.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Potentially better error handling.

1461875705,2078,[NV-1233] 🚀 Feature:  Ability to send emails to unsubscribed users,"### 🔖 Feature description

Here is an example for this use-case, 
we want to send the emails to some users which are not registered in our app i.e ""Invite users to app"" email.
at this point we only have their emails, we can send the emails by using their email as a subscriberId, but in that case we'll have alot on unregistered users in subsribers list and in database which we don't want.
It also dispatch inApp notification if the template has inApp step configured which is kindof extra data which we don't need because the user doesn't exist in the application.

as novu already handles mailing and it's provider configuration, it'd be really great to have this feature so that custom maling service can be replaced with novu.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

It will allow us to send emails to the unregistered users.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I've not seen the code in detail but I have few options not sure if those are the best.
* a separate API for guest emails, which will just dispatch the email.
* a flag in trigger API along with preference override so we can disable the rest of channels and only enable email. the flag will be used to identify that the subscriber is not registered so we don't need to store it in DB

1459728544,2069,[NV-1210] 🐛 Bug Report: Chat notifications failing (Discord),"### 📜 Description

I have set up a notification for when someone replies to a comment. It is working fine for in-app notifications, but fails when trying to set a chat notification even though the credentials have been set.

The workflow looks as follows:

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/9f562e9c-3b75-4a87-9b9c-12057025b4fa/f33018b3-a02e-4329-9cae-517fc0ba6e4f)

but when testing it, it fails on the chat step

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/16f7ee12-a94e-44ef-a08c-302dd01b114b/04c5e978-1965-49e5-ae76-58f035e2cc85)

Note: this is a different error to when the credentials have not been set (see image below), so I believe there is something wrong with the implementation on your side

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/3f908019-e426-42bd-8925-d7ceffcd3858/24f879cf-05ef-4c98-b1ea-a89b9b096a5d)

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Set credentials with Novu

   ```
   await novu.subscribers.setCredentials(ctx.session.user.id, ChatProviderIdEnum.Discord, {
     webhookUrl: input.discordWebhookUrl,
   });
   ```
2. Trigger workflow test
3. Chat notification fails

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should send a notification to my Discord server

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/16f7ee12-a94e-44ef-a08c-302dd01b114b/04c5e978-1965-49e5-ae76-58f035e2cc85)

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

Here is a list of my subscribers

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/9c0c85be-d199-4ddc-940d-94236a7a29de/8c64791f-5ca1-4d23-895e-2623853624df)

When I set the credentials with `ctx.session.user.id`, which is `cl76njlpq17133dpaebxdkrqz` in the above image, it fails. When I set it with `633058cf27d50dea0b00a8ce`, it works (which is my Novu account's ID). This leads me to believe it has something to do with the difference between the 2 subscriber accounts, but I'm not sure.

1459443750,2064,🚀 Feature: Add Mailchain SDK for messaging Web3 names and identities (blockchain addresses),"### 🔖 Feature description

You can use Mailchain to send end-to-end encrypted emails to Web3 names, such as ENS names, and Web3 identities, such as blockchain wallet addresses. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Users expect to be communicated with via the communication channels that fit their needs and goals. There is a growing trend towards platforms offering the choice of user login with SMTP email addresses or blockchain wallet addresses. If the Mailchain SDK is integrated, Novu's single API can be used to communicate with all users regardless of channel, whether they provide an SMTP email or blockchain wallet address. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Mailchain's open source SDK takes care of the complexity working with the REST API including signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting. The installation guide can be found here: https://docs.mailchain.com/developer/installation

Developer flow: 
1. Create a Mailchain account on [https://app.mailchain.com/register](url) for your application to use for sending Web emails. 
2. Create a relay API 'send' service which authenticates with and can send using your Mailchain account. (Example here: [https://docs.mailchain.com/developer/tutorials/send-via-api](url))
3. Create an authenticated webhook to extend the 'send' API, which prevents unauthorised relay (Example here: [https://docs.mailchain.com/developer/tutorials/authenticated-webhook](url))
4. From Novu, call the 'send' endpoint with the message details. 

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Mailchain also works with Mailto: functionality for easy Web3-native user-to-user communication in platforms.

1. Trigger notification with variable which contains Html tags in it.
2. Use that vaiable as notification content in Novu's Admin control pannel.
3. Content will be tiggered to user but with parsed html variable.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Parsing Html tage to Hex code.

### 💻 Operating system

It would be nice if you could unset credentials for e.g. a Slack workspace

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Currently you need to do:

```
await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, {
  webhookUrl: undefined,
});
```

which isn't too much of a hassle, but is potentially confusing

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Having something like `unsetCredentials`, such as

```
await novu.subscribers.unsetCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack);
```

would be nice

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I'm not sure if you guys want to, or already do support subscribing to multiple Slack work spaces / Discord servers, but that could be something to keep in mind

1448088133,2023,[NV-1187] Need option to override `tls` configuration ,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently, as per the support Novu has, it only takes a couple of arguments like User, Password, Host, Port, Secure, etc to create the transport. However, while using only these my Nodemailer configuration is throwing the following error

![](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/8451f9d8-6652-4817-a0c4-7b80067256bb/ec2f230c-7b8d-46d4-a0e6-946df7f3980f)

I believe this has to do with an additional `tls` configuration (more on this [here](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/)) that has to be provided in order to make it work (for the SMTP details I am using). The exact same code snippet for the same functionality will be,

```
nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: process.env.MAILBOX_HOST,
        port: process.env.MAILBOX_PORT,
        secure: false,
        requireTLS: true,
        auth: {
            user: process.env.SMTP_EMAIL_ID,
            pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
        },
        tls: { ciphers: ""SSLv3"" },
})
```

I believe Novu doesn't support the addition `tls` override configuration, which should be added.

*More on nodejs TLSSocket options* [*here*](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket)

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I am using the same SMTP mailbox details in one of my existing projects, that I want to migrate to Novu. However, currently, it is not working. Also, I believe many others will also face the same issue.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Novu should be able to provide additional configuration override options like -

1. `tls`
2. `ignoreTLS`
3. `requireTLS`

1445123654,2007,[NV-1235] 🚀 Feature: Push (FCM) data messages,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently Novu only allows to send what Firebase calls Notification messages, with a ""notification"" field in the payload. It is then automatically handled by FCM SDK as explained here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages

This is very limiting.

The feature would allow to either:
- Send **Data message** that can be handled in the service worker with `onBackgroundMessage`, or
- Allow on Novu to customize the **Notification message** template with actions, buttons, logos, etc.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Because otherwise you're not able to use Firebase `onBackgroundMessage` function to display actions / buttons, etc.

If you do so with the **Notification** message sent by Novu, you get the notification twice, as explained in this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66697332/firebase-web-push-notifications-is-triggered-twice-when-using-onbackgroundmessag

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Modify Novu API + web app to allow for:
- **Data messages**
- More customization of the **Notification messages** (actions, logos, etc.)

1435814741,1960,🚀 Feature: Digest capability for the data field in push notifications,"### 🔖 Feature description

The push notification message request contains a field called 'data', which contains data that an app might use to handle the way the notification is processed. Currently there is no way to digest the data in this field.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use case, the data field contains a uri used to navigate to a certain page in the app. However depending on whether the event triggering the notification was digested or the only one that was triggered, the URI will change. So I would like to be able to know whether the notification is a digested one and send the data accordingly.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Let the user create a template for the data field and enter values that they need to send in the data field.

The issues with the current docker containers are:
- include dev dependencies
- do not use production pnpm builds 
- include python of which is not used in the system
- they do not optimize the COPY command 
- use standard out when installing modules
- does not ensure dev dependencies are removed with pruning

The current size of the containers is ~2GB on average this can slow down deployments due to the time it takes to pull the images and can cost customers with private registries extra (average $0.10/GB per month).

### Recommendations:
- Aim to go [Distroless ](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) in the long-term and move to node16:alpine in the short term
- do multi-stage production builds for all containers and ensure only the app files are moved
- do silent installs to minimize the use of stdout
- use prod build flags and use prune when building in the build container
- [Bundle ](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) the app into one file/binary (This will not work for the frontend)

Containers should be  <1 GB and < 0.5GB being optimal.

1428111741,1907,🚀 Feature: Building up Pushwoosh,"### 🔖 Feature description

Currently the Pushwoosh Push provider is very low built and not up to par with the other services while it could be. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

When looking through the documentation I noticed there were many more modes to the studying sent messages and sending messages that come straight out the box with Pushwoosh. Pushwoosh is a very dynamic push provider that doesn't have a main purpose of sending messages, but sending responses on certain signals of receiving a push notification which makes it contrast it's fellow push proivders.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

The best to achieve this is to mess around with the architecture of the Novu push provider base class and allow modularity to what this needs. Mainly, the base function should create a monitor based on the constructor gives, then the extended class would contain many smaller functions that are encapsulated in a larger, main function. This function could use a hash map effect to link commands to the encapsulated functions and call it depending the on the user's end goal.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I have already put it push request #1876 to create the base structure for the Pushwoosh provider. Once this provider gets merged to the main branch this work can begin as it is very far behind the other providers.

1413693553,1778,🚀 Feature: custom SMTP provider,"### 🔖 Feature description

Create non-branded, ""_library-agnostic_"" ""Custom SMTP"" provider to the integrations store. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This can help users who are not familiar with _Nodemailer_, or _EmailJS_, or other provider  to focus on setting up integration and not deciding whether to choose one provider or another. This choice could be, and from my point of view, should be managed by Novu's core team. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

We can rename existing or create a new integration for ""Custom SMTP"" provider. 
Under the hood, it will be good to use _Nodemailer_ library as it's the most popular library for these purposes. 

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Another option is to consolidate all existing SMTP providers into one ""Custom SMTP"" integration, giving user an ability to choose which provider to use, for example, in select. And also we can have _Nodemailer_ selected by default with a helper text explaining these select options.

   - [x] bug report
   - [ ] feature request
   - [x] question about the decisions made in the repository
   - [ ] question about how to use this project

- **Summary**
  - The text added under PR #1406 for Tamil Support is taken directly from Google translate and lacks nuance. There were three words/phrases that were to be translated, I've broken down the same below
  - I can only speak for the Tamil translation (as I have native/bilingual proficiency) but the extended conversation around the translations makes me worry that the other languages face similar issues. I feel that this would turn away the audience that this feature should be making the app accessible to

- **Other information**

  - ""அனைத்தையும் வாசிக்கப்பட்டதாக அடையாளமிடு"" can be translated to ""Indicate that everything has been read"" - this is mostly used in the context of agreements such as ""I accept the terms of service""

  - ""x பயன்படுத்தி கட்டப்பட்டது"" or ""xமூலம் கட்டப்பட்டது"" (Built using x) could be used as an alternative to ""xமூலம் இயக்கப்படுகிறது"" which technically means ""runs using x"" but in the context of executes on, in the way that a program runs on a computer

  - ""செட்டிங்ஸ்"" is the romanization of Settings - that is, the phonetic sounds made using Tamil letters. While most people who use devices would know what this is trying to convey, ""அமைப்புகள்"" might be a better fit here

- **What I'd suggest**
  - Fix the aforementioned translations (I'd like to take this up)
  - Have someone who speaks the language on a daily basis cross-check the translations periodically",,

Recently novu introduced an easy way to add translations for the @novu/notification-center component interface. So we can either specify a translation object or pass a premade translation.

## How?

- Add a new translation file here: packages/notification-center/src/i18n/languages. You can follow the en.ts example.

- Add your translation import to the TRANSLATIONS object at packages/notification-center/src/i18n/lang.ts

- Add the language code to I18NLanguage type at lang.ts file.

An event/hook which fires when a new notification comes in

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Right now a workaround is by listening to DOM changes on the unseen badge see my working code below I currently use in combination with Swal2

```js

    let unseenBadgeSelector = ""#unseen-badge"";
    setTimeout(() => {
        let savedCount = ($(unseenBadgeSelector).html() == """" ? 0 :Number.parseInt($(unseenBadgeSelector).html()));
        setInterval(() => {
            let currentCount = ($(unseenBadgeSelector).html() == """" ? 0 :Number.parseInt($(unseenBadgeSelector).html()));
            if(currentCount > savedCount){
                $(document).trigger(""new_novu_notification"", [currentCount, (currentCount - savedCount)]);
                savedCount = currentCount;
            }
        }, 1000);
    }, 2500); // Wait for novu to load initial badge count


    $(document).on(""new_novu_notification"", function (totalNotifications, newNotifications){
        Swal.fire({
            text: `${newNotifications} new notification(s)`,

1406699374,1696,🚀 Feature: Deno Support,"### 🔖 Feature description

I would find it cool if Deno support would be added. 

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Novu is a really cool project and I think it would be welcome in the Deno ecosystem too. 

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I don't know exactly what the best choice to achieve this would be. There is [dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt), but it would require a complete rewrite to Deno to support Node... Maybe a separate package for Deno as [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-deno) has done or [feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/deno) is currently working on

### 🔄️ Additional Information

It is of course possible to use Novu through [esm.sh](https://esm.sh) or the unstable [npm specifiers](https://deno.com/blog/v1.25#experimental-npm-support), but a ""native"" support is in my opinion better.

1406441115,1689,🚀 Feature: Augment the issue template with 2 more semantic templates,"### 🔖 Feature description

I noticed that the current issue template limits a contributor to two scopes (**bug report** and **feature**), this is not convenient at all. 

- The major problem I noticed with this is that people have been opening **DOCS** issues using both **BUG REPORT** and **FEATURE** templates. Documentation changes should have a dedicated template

- Considering that many changes and improvements/suggestions are beyond the scope of just bug reports and features. There should be a **documentation** template as well as an **OTHER** template for opening issues that are outside the scope of documentation, bugs etc. This is important in separating the issues into their respective categories. Plus, tracking closed issues becomes easier if they are well grouped together.



### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

This is needed because the current method of creating issues for non-bug/non-feature issues is not convenient

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I want to introduce 2 more templates, namely:
- **DOCS**
- **OTHER**

- The **Why** heading should be replaced with **Why Novu?**
- Under the **Why** section, There's a paragraph that reads ""notifications are spread around the **code**. What Code, I think the author meant something else here. Maybe something like notifications are spread around the world
- Replace **between the system** with **between a system**

### Features section

- Notification should be in plural form with an (s) in ""Easily manage **notification** over multiple channels""

### Embeddable notification center section

- **iframe** should be **IFrame**

### Providers section

- consider replacing **simple to use** with **convenient** under Providers section. 

### Need help section

- consider changing **with the project** to **with this project**
- **then join our Discord..** should be **join our Discord**

### Thanks to all contributors section

- **Thanks a lot!** is repeated twice here. remove the redundant **thanks a lot**


> **Note**: I noticed that some headings are in **T**itle **C**ase while some are in **S**entence Case. This is not recommended. The casing of the headings should be consistent (i.e either all headings be in Title case or Sentence case but not a mixture of both)

1404983569,1647,[NV-1015] - Create webhook parser for Termii (sms),"**Why**

To be able to give better answers why a message was not sent to a subscriber we need to get some info from the provider with a webhook. (deliverability status, rejection status etc).

**How**

To do this we need to implement these functions inside of the provider:

```
  getMessageId?: (body: any | any[]) => string[];

  parseEventBody?: (
    body: any | any[],
    identifier: string
  ) => IEmailEventBody | undefined;

The `getMessageId` needs to return all identifiers that should be the same value as id that is returned from `sendMessage` with help of this we can connect a webhook to the specific message.

`parseEventBody` will get the full webhook body and the current identifier that the body should be parsed for. If there is nothing to parse the method should return `undefined`. 

All returns that is not `undefined` should be an object that is in this format:

```
status: string;

 date: string;

externalId?: string;

attempts?: number;

response?: string;

// Contains the raw content for message from the provider webhook

row?: string;
```

1404684772,1633,🐛 Bug Report:  Delayed digested flow digests but sends notification multiple times,"### 📜 Description

My workflow as follows:

- I delay the messages with a scheduledAt parameter to wait until a certain time (tomorrow 8AM for example)
- I then put a digest block to combine those delayed messages into a ""Daily update mail"" for 10 seconds (assuming the workflow won't take much time to send them to the next block)

It seems if I am sending 2 messages like this, it sends me 2 digested notifications (with the same content) instead of 1

{{#if step.digest}}
{{#each step.events}}
    {{test}}
 {{/each}}
 {{else}}
 Not a digested template
 {{/if}}

Currently different places in codebase use different links to link to novu's discord server, some of which are broken.
If we standardize all to a same link, It will be easier to update in the future as well.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

I came across a broken discord server link, then thought of updating it. Later on I again came across another broken link.
This not only made me commit a lot of times for the exact same thing but also would have forced to open various PR's for the same thing which may appear spammy although someone is indeed doing some contribution.

1398942530,1496,🐛 Bug Report: ,"### 📜 Description

We deploy novu on AWS EC2 instance using docker for the testing purpose and we are very much satisfied with it. But when we are testing SMS  service using twilio, we find out that Handlebars template syntax is not working properly. We send payload in trigger SDK function and also added Handlebars variable in SMS template but still we are getting blank value in place of variable. If we set default value then it always showing default value in final message. We checked payload is going properly with request. isRequired validation is also working properly.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Deploy novu on Linux using docker
2. Create message template and add SMS template with handlebars template
3. trigger event and validate message

### 👍 Expected behavior

It should be display message with handlebars variable on user's side

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

It actually showing blank value instead of custom value given in payload.

1398846800,1492,fix: fixes Odia translation for markAllAsRead field,"# Description

The current Odia translation:
 `markAllAsRead: 'ସମସ୍ତଙ୍କୁ ପଢ଼ିବା ପରି ଚିହ୍ନିତ କର'` translates to something in the lines of `mark all as to-be-read` which is not what we want. 

# Solution:

It should be fixed to `markAllAsRead: 'ସମସ୍ତଙ୍କୁ ପଢ଼ିଥିବା ପରି ଚିହ୍ନିତ କର'` which most accurately describes the action.

1397869227,1471,[NV-997] - Test Amazon SES provider connection when creating/updating integration,"## Why?

Currently, when the user connects a provider from the Integration store, there's no option to `Test the provider connection` before saving/updating it for wrong/bad credentials or other possible issues.

Without the `Test` functionality, the provider connection is saved with the possible wrong credentials and the issue is discovered at a much later stage.

We want to have a `Test` functionality during the connection stage to let users catch the errors as early as possible.

## How?

We will need to create a new method i.e,checkIntegration for the `SES` provider.

Currently, we have a placeholder `checkIntegration` method, you will need to update this method accordingly.

Look into the SES docs and if they provide a dedicated endpoint or method to test the connection, then implement the same inside the checkIntegration method.

If there's no dedicated endpoint/method provided by SES, then re-use the `send` functionality of the provider to check and ensure proper integration, and return the errors if any.

1397544438,1449,[NV-1013] - Create webhook parser for Twilio (sms),"**Why**

To be able to give better answers why a message was not sent to a subscriber we need to get some info from the provider with a webhook. (deliverability status, rejection status etc).

**How**

To do this we need to implement these functions inside of the provider:

```
  getMessageId?: (body: any | any[]) => string[];

  parseEventBody?: (
    body: any | any[],
    identifier: string
  ) => IEmailEventBody | undefined;
```

The `getMessageId` needs to return all identifiers that should be the same value as id that is returned from `sendMessage` with help of this we can connect a webhook to the specific message.

`parseEventBody` will get the full webhook body and the current identifier that the body should be parsed for. If there is nothing to parse the method should return `undefined`. 

All returns that is not `undefined` should be an object that is in this format:

```
status: string;

 date: string;

externalId?: string;

attempts?: number;

response?: string;

// Contains the raw content for message from the provider webhook

row?: string;
```

Note that statuses for email needs to be value from `EmailEventStatusEnum` and sms should have a status from `SmsEventStatusEnum.`

**Error**
When starting a self-hosted `novu` docker container, `API` does not start and shows the following error,
![sentry-dsn_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50201755/193959129-92689052-3b81-4ec6-b4aa-ab7a74aa6b29.png)

**Warning**
Novu is now using `new-relic`, While starting self-hosted novu, it shows the following warning,
![novu_new-relic_errro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50201755/193959537-43d1c34b-80c1-4504-ae53-ad05f789f40b.png)


### 👟 Reproduction steps

Make sure that `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed,

1. Clone the `Novu`
2. Go to the `docker` folder by `cd docker`
3. Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` by `cp .env.example .env`
4. Start the container by running the command `docker-compose up`
5. See the `api` logs

### 👍 Expected behavior

While self-hosting `novu`, it should be up and running without errors.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Self-hosted `novu` is not starting and showing the following error

### 💻 Operating system

Windows

### 🤖 Node Version

v16.17.0

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

The error can be resolved by adding a `SENTRY_DSN` entry in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

And If we are using `new-relic` credentials in the application then we should make its entry in the `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` files. So that users can provide credentials if they want to.

Add Polish language to the library

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

Recently we introduced an easy way to add translations for the @novu/notification-center component interface. So you can either specify a translation object or pass a premade translation. Read more about it on the [docs](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/react-components#customize-the-ui-language).

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

- Add a new translation file here: packages/notification-center/src/i18n/languages. You can follow the en.ts example.
- Add your translation import to the TRANSLATIONS object at packages/notification-center/src/i18n/lang.ts
- Add the language code to I18NLanguage type at lang.ts file.

1387601471,1303,🐛 Bug Report: Integration store FCM is not at par with the docs,"### 📜 Description

Steps mentioned in the docs to integrate FCM with Novu.

> To enable the FCM integration, you need to get your service account key from the Firebase dashboard. You can acquire the account key JSON by selecting your project, clicking the gear icon in top of the sidebar, going to service account tab and download the JSON. After that, manually get the values from the JSON to the right fields. You can use a tool like [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) to get the values more easily.

However, the form to add FCM as an integration only contains one field by the name of service account. What are we supposed to paste over there? The whole JSON file or something else?

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Navigate to the Integration Store in admin panel
2. Try to connect FCM , which is mentioned under Push

### 👍 Expected behavior

Should contain multiple form fields.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

1387563474,1302,🚀 Feature: Expiration Time for FCM Tokens,"### 🔖 Feature description

Following to [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/manage-tokens), They recommend us to store tokens with expiration time and remove token if it staled. Also it would be nice to have option to remove token from user if it's being connected to another.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

- Avoid forcing user to have a cron job and update all users tokens (it will be huge load for Novu).
- Novu's database would be clean of salted and outdated tokens
- Avout filtering users and remove token from them.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I want this feature to follow firebase best practice, avoid creation of cron job which will update all users tokens in novu, and removing token when user logged out from app.

1384617271,1294,🚀 Feature: Change Admin features access,"### 🔖 Feature description

Would be great if the access to admin features (`@Roles(MemberRoleEnum.ADMIN)` decorator) used a special token instead, like Supabase and its SERVICE_ROLE key.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

When interacting with the API programmatically, some endpoints are only available for Admin users. However, it requires them to be logged in, which may not be possible for instance when using social providers or the user might not want to put its credentials in the app, even using env variables.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

I'd like another Api key for each environment that only admins can access and that have admin privileges in the api. In a way, that looks like Supabase ANON key (that can be public) and SERVICE_ROLE key (which can bypass RLS).

1383758128,1289,🐛 Bug Report: No way to reset / destroy the `widget_user_auth_token` in the iFrame embed.,"### 📜 Description

I have a Vue app that embeds the iFrame option for displaying the notification center. When I log out the existing user and log in as a new user, the notifications don't get updated. 

The `widget_user_auth_token` is not reset and remains the same. Only after a hard refresh on the page does the notification list update. 

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Embed the iFrame in your app.
2. Log in & check the notification center (also see `widget_user_auth_token`).
3. Log out of the current user.
4. log in as a new user.
5. Check the notification center (and `widget_user_auth_token`).

### 👍 Expected behavior

Step 5 should result in different notifications (and `widget_user_auth_token`) from step 2.

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Both the notifications and `widget_user_auth_token` for steps 2 and for remaining the same.

1382498441,1286,Chat Integration with Mattermost🚀 Feature: ,"### 🔖 Feature description

Mattermost is an Open Source Slack alternative that also allows managed as well as  Self hosting. 
It is used by a lot of teams and would be an excellent point for notifications similar to Slack, MS Teams or Discord.  
Mattermost supports REST API 

https://mattermost.com/platform-overview/

https://api.mattermost.com/

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

While email notifications are good. Notification to other channels like slack or Mattermost is very important. Self hosted Mattermost is used by our organization and is done by many other organizations too. This will be very helpful to send notifications to Mattermost in addition to email and SMS.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

In the integration store add option to integrate the Mattermost sever. By providing the mattermost server URL, API User, Team and the channel to post to the integration can be created. Then similar to Slack, a user can add and Chat in the Novu Workflow Editor and send notifications to the Mattermost Server's Channel.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Our organization is using a self hosted mattermost server. I can create a new team, make it available for testing.

1366309087,1247,[NV-1245] 🚀 Feature: Validate email provider emails sent,"### 🔖 Feature description

Validate email bounce back and update the event status in novu ui to errored

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

We use the mailgun provider and was testing what happens when we sent to a known bad email address, and as far as novu displaying that email was successful, and technically it was mailgun successfully triggered the email, but it bounced back in another event saying email was invalid.

Would be nice to see novu validate bounce back and update the event in novu itself to errored, we could then notify the person who triggered that email that it failed. and the mailgun error telling them of the bounce back.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

1.Novu client sends an email workflow trigger
2. Mailgun successfully sends the email (in mailgun you see the event as successful)
4. A couple seconds later you get another event in mailgun with an error of bounce back due to invalid email
5. Novu sees this new error from mailgun and updates the novu event to errored that was triggered by novu client.
6. Do whatever you want with that updated status (in our case we would update the client who triggered the event)

1365012650,1242,🐛 Bug Report: Chrome console error when uploading company logo,"### 📜 Description

When attempting to upload a company logo, after selecting what image you want to add and pressing open, nothing happens visually. Upon inspecting the chrome console logs I am getting a couple of errors.

We originally thought it was the proxy buffer size on nginx ingress in front of these services, we increased it from the default 1m to 1g (just so we could rule out any picture size issues with the reverse proxy itself). The same errors happen after we did that.

So without having any of the S3 variables filled out I have to presume that the picture is assumed to be stored as an s3 object, I could not find any documentation of the sorts.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Setup a self hosted instance of the novu apps (I don't have any of the s3 env variables filled out)
3. Open browser console
2. Go to web frontend
4. Go to ""Settings""

1364998405,1241,"🐛 Bug Report: Invite user to org, email isn't being sent","### 📜 Description

I set up a self hosted environment on gke, when I go to invite someone to the org that I created the email itself for the invite never gets sent, Now I'm sure it's something I have overlooked but I am unable to find any docs/env variables about what the novu app itself uses to send the invite email. we currently have mailgun setup as a provider and tested functionality via the novu go client and are able to send notifications via mailgun so we know the provider itself works.

novu version: 0.7.3

### 👟 Reproduction steps

1. Setup a self hosted instance of the novu apps
2. Properly configure mailgun provider
3. Go to ""Team Members""
4. Type in a valid email in the ""Invite user by email"" field
5. Press Invite
6. Nothing happens (you get a invite sent to email address notification but no email)

### 👍 Expected behavior

I should be seeing the invite to Org email in whatever email was typed in for invite

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

Team Members screen says invite pending but nothing further happens

### 💻 Operating system

1363192684,1220,[NV-1247] 🚀 Feature: Add websocket event for new notifications,"### 🔖 Feature description

This feature would resolve some issues that you might encounter when implementing some custom functionality on the frontend. In addition to the existing `unseen_count_changed` event, I propose to add another event such as `notification_received` which would contain all the relevant data for a new notification as follows:

```
{
    _id: ""_id"",
    _templateId: ""_templateId"",
    _environmentId: ""_environmentId"",
    _messageTemplateId: ""_messageTemplateId"",
    _organizationId: ""_organizationId"",
    _notificationId: ""_notificationId"",
    _subscriberId: ""_subscriberId"",
    subscriber: subscriber,
    template: template,
    templateIdentifier: ""templateIdentifier"",
    createdAt: ""createdAt"",
    content: ""content"",
    transactionId: ""transactionId"",
    channel: ""channel"",
    seen: true,
    email: ""email"",
    phone: ""phone"",
    directWebhookUrl: ""directWebhookUrl"",
    providerId: ""providerId"",
    deviceTokens: [""deviceTokens""],
    title: ""title"",
    lastSeenDate: ""lastSeenDate"",
    cta: cta,
    _feedId: ""_feedId"",
    status: ""status"",
    errorId: ""errorId"",
    errorText: ""errorText"",
    payload: payload,
    overrides: overrides,
    subject: ""subject""
}
```

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

While there are already nice solutions for displaying events in a UI such as the useNotifications hook and the Novu API, adding this event would give developers more flexibility when building their UIs. For example, you could reduce the load on the client by fetching events using the API, and then simply listen for new events by websocket and update the UI when appropriate.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

By creating a new event that users can subscribe to and execute relevant logic when such an event is emitted.

First problem
I am literally getting shocked by this. I think it would be better to assign them as a `normal member` first and allow the admin to modify it over the backend. Any clue on this?

1355558881,1153,🐛 Bug Report: 0.7.0 release zip points to 0.6.2 docker images,"### 📜 Description

Downloading the `https://github.com/novuhq/novu/archive/refs/tags/v0.7.0.zip` file from the 0.7.0 release assets results in a docker-compose.yml file that still points to 0.6.2 docker images.
For example:
```
api:
    image: ""ghcr.io/novuhq/novu/api:0.6.2""
```

Should it not point to the same images as main branch in this case?

```
api:
    image: ""ghcr.io/novuhq/novu/api:0.7.0""
```

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Go to releases page and download the zip file from release assets.  Open docker-compose.yml.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Point to 0.7.0 images?

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

From 0.7.0 release zip...

1352999149,1137,🚀 Feature: SSE (Server Sent Events) support,"### 🔖 Feature description

Support for SSE

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

SSE is best used when it's not necessary to send data from client to server. In status updates and push notification applications, the data flow -usually- follows a single path that is from the server to the client only.

This is what SSE is designed for, so WebSocket would be overkill as you are opening UDP bi-directional channels at each request/user which will consume server resources with all probability.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

Replicating websocket implementation with SSE should be relatively easy. See [Server-Sent Events](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/server-sent-events) in Nest JS documentation.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

Websockets and SSE (Server Sent Events) are both capable of pushing data **to** browsers, however they are not competing technologies.

Websockets connections can both send data to the browser and receive data from the browser. A good example of an application that could use websockets is a chat application.

**SSE connections can only push data to the browser**. Notifications, Online stock quotes, or RRSS updating the timeline or feed are good examples of an application that could benefit from SSE.

In practice since everything that can be done with SSE can also be done with Websockets, however, it can be overkill for some types of application, and the server will consume less resources when using SSE.

SSE applies a _publish-subscribe pattern_ or _request-respond pattern_, despite the response is a stream.

**Browser support:**

[Server-sent events. Eventsource](https://caniuse.com/eventsource) ~97.97%

Furthermore SSE can be polyfilled into older browsers that do not support it natively using just JavaScript. Some implementations of SSE polyfills can be found on the [Moderniz github page](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills).

**Related Libs:**
- [EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource/blob/master/src/eventsource.js) by Yaffle.
- [EventSource](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js) by Remi Sharp.
- [Nest JS - SSE](https://github.com/serkyron/nestjs-sse) by serkyron (Note that it's not using HTTP2).

**Limitations:**

- **Maximum open connections limit.** SSE over HTTP/1.1 suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be specially painful when opening various tabs as the limit is per browser and set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as ""Won't fix"" in [Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=275955) and [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906896). This limit is per browser + domain, so that means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.mywebsite1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.mywebsite2.com.
- When using **HTTP/2** (recommended), the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).
- **No binary support.** While WS can transmit both binary data and UTF-8, SSE is limited to UTF-8.

**Extended information sources:**
- [EventSource basics](https://web.dev/eventsource-basics/)
- [EventSource MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)
- [WHATWG Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-eventsource-interface)

**TL;DR**
In Server-sent Events, the communication is carried out from server to browser only, the browser/client cannot send any data to the server through the same connection. This kind of communication is mainly used when the need is only to show the updated data, then the server sends the message whenever the data gets updated. It is a one-way communication from the Server to the client attached to a given event.

1351770685,1129,🐛 Bug Report: React Notification Center causes full page changes,"### 📜 Description

When the React notification widget is loaded, it causes the entire page to change font family and color.

### 👟 Reproduction steps

Load the notification center on any page with a stylesheet loaded to add colors/fonts to body.

### 👍 Expected behavior

Not do this :wink

### 👎 Actual Behavior with Screenshots

### 💻 Operating system

Windows

### 🤖 Node Version

NA

### 📃 Provide any additional context for the Bug.

This is caused by the widget injecting a global style tag into the body, specifically this one: ![image](https://up.pxl.ac/2022/G3RjV/I7G09UGsYd.png)

This style tag overrides the body styling *if* the main sites body styling is in a stylesheet, as style tags take precedence over embedded stylesheets.

Should be easily fixed by simply removing that injected style as it isn't needed anyways(as far as I can tell)

1346229943,1104,[NV-822] - Flaky widget test for update realtime notifications,"## What?

Recently looks like the `should update real time for new notifications` test in `apps/widget` fails with the following assertion:

```

Re-running this test usually solves the problem. 

Looks like it's some sort of a race condition with the socket or updating sequence. 

My suspect is the following file: `packages/notification-center/src/components/novu-provider/NovuProvider.tsx`

Where the following code:

```
function UnseenProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { unseenCount, setUnseenCount } = useUnseenController();
  const { socket } = useSocket();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (socket) {
      socket.on('unseen_count_changed', (onData: { unseenCount: number }) => {
        if (!isNaN(onData?.unseenCount)) {
          setUnseenCount(onData.unseenCount);

1341193190,1050,Add Kannel SMS provider,"## What?
To add [kannel](https://kannel.org/) as a new SMS provider, similar the the NodeMailer Email provider, an underlying protocol provider.

## Why?
So kannel users, and people who want to use SMS gateway could do that with Novu, while simply hosting kannel on their network.

## How?
First thing, the assumption is a kannel server is already up and running. Looking into [kannel userguide](https://kannel.org/download/1.4.5/userguide-1.4.5/userguide.html), section Table 7-17. SMS Push (send-sms) CGI Variables we can see how send SMS using this game. See below basic 

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| username  | configured to use kannel interface  |
| password  | configured to use kannel interface  |
| from  | shortcode  |
| to  | cellphone number  |
| smsc  | an id of the connection,  usually given for each mobile operator  |
| text  | text of the SMS, URL encoded  |
| priority  | Sets the Priority value (range 0-3 is allowed). (Defaults to 0, which is the lowest priority). |
| meta-data - optional  | For SMPP  |
| dlr-mask  | Request for delivery reports with the state of the sent message  |
| dlr-url  | Request for delivery reports with the state of the sent message wehbook url  |





Add new provider based on [this guide](https://docs.notifire.co/docs/community/create-provider)

## Usage
Example for Kannel SMS provider registration needs to be finalized.
```ts
await notifire.registerProvider(
  new KannelSmsProvider({
    username: process.env.KANNEL_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.KANNEL_PASSWORD,
    host: process.env.KANNEL_HOST,
    port: process.env.KANNEL_PORT,
    dlr-mask: process.env.KANNEL_DLR_MASK, // most likely mask 31 so Novu can get all reports
    dlr-url: process.env.KANNEL_DLR_URL,
  })
);
```

## More Information
In order for Kannel integration to work there is one major change from other ""simple"" SMS provider, that is the smsc variable. In most cases this is being handled by SMS provider, in Kannel this needs to be passed, and in case the mobile operator was not found/found not found on mobile operator, a response using dlr-mask,  another mobile operator should be tried.

This could be resolved as a variable in the `trigger` function, and an iterative process up until the message was received on the phone or the mobile operator. Can see mapping [here](https://gist.github.com/grantpullen/3d550f31c454e80fda8fc0d5b9105fd0).

1340252755,1041,🚀 Feature: iFrame Embed Customization,"### 🔖 Feature description

It would be nice if it was possible to customize the colors, text, font, etc.

### 🎤 Why is this feature needed ?

In my use case, my software has a color palette that doesn't match Novu colors. It would be interesting to change the language too, because my software is in Portuguese, for example.

### ✌️ How do you aim to achieve this?

This functionality would be of great help not only to me but to many other users.

### 🔄️ Additional Information

I tried to inject a file into the iFrame but i've failed. There's no way to do it. Maybe a HTML injection instead of iFrame would be more easy to customize.

1338689569,1027,[Bug]: Password visibility toggle buttons inside `PasswordInput` are not accessible by keyboard.,"**Describe the bug**
Password visibility buttons present in Sign Up and Login In pages are not accessible by keyboard. User can't focus on them using `tab` or `shift + tab` keys.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Setup project locally.
2. Run `npm run start:web` and go to `http://localhost:4200/auth/signup` on your browser.
3. Try to input fields using keyboard (`tab` or `shift + tab`).
4. When focus comes to password field, the focus directly goes to `SignUp` button without coming to `toggle password visibility button (the eye icon)` that makes it keyboard inaccessible.

**Expected behavior**
After coming inside password field, user should directed to `toggle password visibility button (the eye icon)`  after tapping `tab` key from keyboard.

**Challenge:**

When users receive a large amount of notifications it’s hard to mark all of them manually as seen/read, a common UX behavior is to have a “mark all as seen” functionality. 

**Solution:**

Have a `Mark All as Read` button. Here is the wireframes and design will be added by @shlomtzyk

* When there are no notifications - disable the button.
* This ticket relates to read / unread and read all - seen and not seen are not in scope.
* Update the badge with the correct number of unread.

Recently we introduced an easy way to add translations for the `@novu/notification-center` component interface. So you can either specify a translation object or pass a premade translation. Read more about it on the [docs](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/react-components#customize-the-ui-language). 

## How?

* Add a new translation file here: `packages/notification-center/src/i18n/languages`. You can follow the `en.ts` example.
* Add your translation import to the `TRANSLATIONS` object at `packages/notification-center/src/i18n/lang.ts` 
* Add the language code to `I18NLanguage` type at `lang.ts` file.

1326095051,936,[NV-707] - [Design] Loading state For Select Component,"## Why?

Currently, our select/multi-select component has a loading state that covers the label, description and not just the input. 

![Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 10.18.06.png](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/a486dc38-b521-4a98-a25f-889d9939ba0c/06336c77-eb78-4bad-ad4d-59844a21c86e)

## What?

Change the select component so that the loading would be only on the input field. So label and description would always show and loader will look as follows: 

[Loader - Concepting (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/9jalQvImfHtbbExZPLW3XO/Concepting?node-id=2834%3A39667)

Note - This is implemented using Mantine's [Select](https://v4.mantine.dev/core/select/) and [LoadingOverlay](https://v4.mantine.dev/core/loading-overlay/) components.

## Where?

1324146682,928,[NV-363] - Improve command.create static method to be reused,"## What?

Right now each usecase command in our API does a code duplication for the static create method for example in the `CompileTemplateCommand` command:

```
export class CompileTemplateCommand {
  static create(data: CompileTemplateCommand) {
    return CommandHelper.create<CompileTemplateCommand>(CompileTemplateCommand, data);
  }

  @IsDefined()
  templateId: 'basic' | 'custom';
}
```

This is repetitive and prone to errors, would be great if we could abstract this static call and still preserve the validation functionality and type support from typescript from each individual command.

The command `create` method is called on the `controller` file when using a usecase, the create will run `class-validators` on all the validation annotations. 

## Why?

The static method is copied around for all commands and it's very repetitive. Are there better solutions for this?

## Done Criteria

* The `create` method is reused rather than duplicated
* Each command provides the correct type completion when used
* `class-validators` are still working as previously.",,

1323383438,920,[NV-1249] NV 723 Prioritize In-App Notifications,"## What?
Not all notifications are born equal; some are more important than others.
For example, a ""friend request"" on Facebook is more important than a ""like"" on a picture.
So, we need to allow to add a priority number to notifications for sorting.
For example:
Friend request - 1
Like on a picture - 2

So my In-app feed would look like
friend request
friend request
friend request
like on a picture
like on a picture
...more notifications without priority

Also, let the user choose if the notification loses priority once it's being read
## Why?
1. Being able to show the essential user notifications.
2. Make sure the user won't miss those notifications.

## How?
1. Allow adding a priority number to each notification.
2. Add a select box if the notification should lose priority once being add.
3. Arrange them when we query the DB for notifications.

1323378212,919,Merge Unread Digested Notifications,"## What?
If you have multiple unread digested notifications, merge them into a single one (can work mainly with in-app notifications).
Here is an example: I have digested four batches of ""10 people liked your picture"" (4 notifications).
But I haven't logged in to the app for a while.
I would prefer to see one notification of ""40 people liked your picture."" rather than four notifications of ""10 people liked your picture.""

## Why?
It gives more context to the users about other notifications instead of spamming them with the same digest.

## How?
Every time a digest is completed, check if there is an old unread digest of the same type and merge it.
It's basically better to delete the old one and create another one so it will be on the top of the list.

In 'Settings' menu, 'Api Keys' tab, I am not expecting to have my 'Application identifier', it is confusing.

## Why?

To make it easier for developers to understand the mechanism and have a better integration experience.

## How?

Either the tab name may be changed from 'Api Keys' to something more generic, or the application identifier can be moved somewhere else like below the ""Development / Production"" switch thingy.

Also the documentation shall be updated to make it clear that the API key is used to create the HMAC and not the APP ID.

1308670273,865,Allow non AWS infrastructure setups NV-681,"## What?
Currently, Novu is coupled to AWS through its .env config. It would be nice to allow a developer to setup with an alternative infrastructure provider, such as Google Cloud Platform (a.k.a GCP), instead.

## Why?
Some company's are known to be a complete AWS, GCP, or Azure shop. They wouldn't be able to adopt this repo on-prem if they were not on AWS. The only way about this is to fork this repo, update the AWS logic, and replace it with a GCP one. Adding logic to a forked repo just makes it a little harder to keep it up to date with the upstream source. It would be best if we can avoid that and make the adoption to this repo a little easier.

## How?
A potentially better experience might be to allow a developer to either specify the minimum GCP, AWS, or Azure configurations to get the application running with their chosen infrastructure provider. Since I'm only writing because I'm interested in GCP, I'll list out the items that should be done for that.

1. .env.example. : demonstrate the GCP related configs that can be potentially placed there (i.e `GCP_SECRETY_ACCESS_KEY`, `GCS_REGION`, etc). I'm not fully sure what minimum information is required to store items in Google Cloud Storage, but those would have to be laid out in this file. 
2. env-validator.ts : Update to see if either S3 or GCS (Google Cloud Storage) information has been provided. If not, an error can be thrown.
3. storage.service.ts: Update this file to provide to determine whether to store items in GCP or in AWS. To make this scalable, beyond the GCP scope,  it may make sense to create 1 file per provider (i.e. S3StorageService and a GCSStorageService) with a common interface. Then, storage.service.ts, can be used to simply select between the different tech depending on the env configs.

More work may be required, but I think this is all that's necessary.

",1188782799,"Thanks for the suggestion @alaboudi !

I definitely thinks it's ok to introduce another `StorageService` to interact with GCP depending on the actually provided keys. We can use the existence of `S3_BUCKET_NAME` or `GCP_BUCKET_NAME` to identify which storage service to actually use. 

Same methodology might be relevant when using other cloud-related services in the future. "

",1189074979,"Yes, exactly what I was thinking. We can let the `StorageService`, or any other service concerned with infrastructure, to abstract away any cloud-service providers.

1303840564,841,Team Members management,"**Describe the bug**
As a team admin, I need to be able to remove/re-invite/change role for team members.
(bonus) When I am not an admin, there is no need to see full email addresses of my team colleagues.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Team Members' menu
2. Add a team member by inviting via email
3. Try to remove the newly invited team member -> no way
4. Try to resent the invite for the pending new team member -> no way

**Expected behavior**
As admin, we should be able to remove team members, change their roles (admin / member), and re-send invite for pending members.

As a team admin, I need to be able to remove/re-invite/change role for team members.
(bonus) When I am not an admin, there is no need to see full email addresses of my team colleagues.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Team Members' menu
2. Add a team member by inviting via email
3. Try to remove the newly invited team member -> no way
4. Try to resent the invite for the pending new team member -> no way

**Expected behavior**
As admin, we should be able to remove team members, change their roles (admin / member), and re-send invite for pending members.
As member (not admin), do not reveal other user emails. (in my case I work with multiple freelancers that do not want their emails exposed)

",1283804877,"Hi @scopsy 👋 

So, point `1.` and `2.` are done with ease.
But for `3.` I need to discuss something with you.

It seems the current `Select` component in the design-system has a custom filter function which removes all the items which are not selected.
So when I make the Select component searchable as discussed in this issue, we will see only the selected element.

We can fix it by adding an optional prop to the Select component in the design system.
However if you know any better idea, do let me know."

1302478203,829, 🐛 Bug(s) and improvment(s) in settings page,"**Describe the bug**
1. Every selected logo-image gets uploaded to AWS-S3 bucket, even the ones which are not the final logo.
2. On changing logo, the old logo isn't getting deleted from S3 bucket, even though new logo has been updated in settings page.
3. Currently, the logo-image selected by user isn't processed in the client-side. If logo-image size is large (both in size and dimension), it should be processed to keep the image within a threshold size and dimension as required in settings page.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
- To check bug-1:
  1. Open https://web.novu.co/settings page.
  2. Select a logo.
  3. Check Networks tab in browser's developer tool for the selected image's upload (PUT) request and GET request.
  5. Follow above steps for more than 1 image to check.

- To check bug-2:
  1. Open https://web.novu.co/settings page.
  2. Open current logo's URL in new tab.
  3. Upload and update settings page with new logo and open new logo's URL in new tab.
  4. Refresh old logo's URL and it would still be available, indicating it isn't deleted from S3 bucket.

**Expected behavior**
1. On updating logo, the old logo-image should get deleted from S3 bucket.
3. The logo should get uploaded, only when `Update` button is pressed.
4. The logo-image selected by user should be properly processed (both in size and dimension) in order to avoid unwanted memory usage by image in S3 bucket.

1266462484,645,Widget auth token clashing with gateway auth token,"## What?
Have a setting to use react component widget without auth (bearer) token being appended to it.

## Why?

We're facing this scenario where  on trying to use the react component for in-app notifications, the component internally takes care of the auth and applies a bearer token for the same. Now this token is actually clashing with our API gateway's auth token. I don't see a way to disable this auth currently. So widget skipping to add this token should help this.

## How?
Perhaps have an environment variable for this setting. Keeping in mind there could be some structure change required in API too (apart from removing auth guards over widget APIs).",,

Most applications would use some sort of RDBMS and most new age BaaS also use RDBMS. Just for using an notification engine supporting self-hosted NoSQL like MongoDB is an overhead. If Novu supports RDBMS, a managed service or a developer would be familiar and easy to work with.  PostgreSQL for example has great JSON support too.

## Why?
Managing multiple services/technologies in production becomes a challenge and supporting a variety of datastores will help simplifying deployment, operations and maintenance

## How?
Maybe use a ORM that supports multiple Databases and most of them support JSON anyway,

## Other information
Since notifications contain PII data, more use cases maybe to self host to comply with local data laws. Supporting multiple datastores  will increase adoption and contribution.

1229402385,546,[NV-388] - GitPod integration setup,"## Why?

GitPod can new contributors setup the project faster and to avoid versioning issues for global dependencies such as Node, pnpm and etc…

## What?

Currently, we have partial support, but looks like a couple of things are missing:

* When compiling the project during rebuild time, we need to run the `npm run setup:project` command instead of just running npm install in the root
* When running the service URL outside of the gitpod tab, services are trying to access the local service using localhost:3000 which is not working since localhost only exists when running inside the vscode browser.  (We need to create a new .env file configuration for GitPod and somehow inject the URLs of the services)
* Consider creating a bootstrap script that creates a default user inside the web platform the GitPod can automatically log in to.
* Currently, yarn start running all projects including the CLI. We should only run: API, WEB, WIDGET, WS and their dependencies
* Any other things we should consider for a better experience?

Current GitPod config runs here: [https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/main/.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/main/.gitpod.yml)",,

* When entered the `` /auth/application `` change the url to \``` https://localhost:4200` `` without completing the form
* The page should load, but nothing will work

1222588559,527,[NV-300] - [Tracking] - HMAC support,"## Why?

Currently, when Novu's user adds the notification center to his application he is required to pass a `$user_id` which identifies the user end-customer identifier and the application Identifier which is acted as a public key. 

A malicious actor can access the user feed by accessing the API and passing another `$user_id` using the public application identifier. 

HMAC will make sure that a $user_id is encrypted using the secret API key, and those will prevent malicious actors from impersonating users.

## What?  

By default, the HMAC should not be enabled to make easier onboarding for our users and testing.  But for production purposes, we should add the ability in the configuration to Enable HMAC encryption using a toggle. 

When enabled at the application level, all requests using the application identifier will be rejected unless it successfully decrypted and exists in the request.

## How?

Currently inside `apps/api/src/app/events/usecases/trigger-event/trigger-event.usecase.ts` we only pass the payload data when calling the `compileTemplate` usecase. The subscriber returned from the repository needs to be passed to the compileTemplate aswell.

1199949981,462,[NV-325] - SegmentedControl switch component,"## Why?

To provide a support for switching environments between development and production, we need to create a UI component to represent that.

## How?

[Environments - Concepting (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/9jalQvImfHtbbExZPLW3XO/Concepting?node-id=1006%3A21319)

We can create a component in our ""design-system"" based on [https://mantine.dev/core/segmented-control/](https://mantine.dev/core/segmented-control/) styled for our needs.

### Done criteria

* Switchable component that can toggle between states
* Supports an initial value prop
* Added to our design system on storybook
* The items can be passed as a prop with value and label",,
1199929693,461,[NV-24] - Tabs - Horizontal Menu,"## **Why?**

We are in the process of creating our new core components using [mantine](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) and creating our very own [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for easier UI development.

To learn more about our design system see [#219](https://github.com/notifirehq/notifire/issues/219)

## **How?**

To start contributing you need to run storybook locally:

```
npm run setup:project
cd apps/web 
npm run storybook
```

To contribute, add a new component directory named `Tabs` in `apps/web/src/design-system/` with the following files:

1\. Component file, overriding Mantine’s default implementation based on the design below.

2\. Styles implementation, to fit our design. Consider dark and light color scheme.

3\. Create a story for the tabs component, showcasing our designs options.

1184923063,417,[NV-283] - Hide pagination when less than items per page returned,"### What?

When less than the number of items per page is returned from the server, hide the pagination element. 

### Where?

On the Activity feed page in the apps/web project

![CleanShot 2022-03-29 at 16.56.45.png](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/032e8e71-cd14-4940-88c0-63ad3e57a8f7/30faa19c-a9f9-43b3-9301-bdf36ed31381)",,
1172490557,378,[NV-241] - Enable runtime dynamic environment variables in web project,"### Why?

Currently when we want to pass dynamic variables for example the API URL (check out `apps/web/src/config/index.ts for example`). We do this using the Create-react-app env variables mechanism that replaces revert process.env with the appropriate value during **build** time. Since there is no such thing as process.env within the browser environment.

When running within a docker environment (check out the docker folder within the project) it forces us to use the ""build"" command inside the CMD command that is triggered when the end-user performance `docker-compose`  Check out the end of the file within `apps/web/Dockerfile`. What we want eventually is to server the already build an application without rebuilding it again each time the docker is started.

### How?

Import the variables from a dynamically populated file. Some examples for this approach can be found in these links:

* [https://dev.to/akdevcraft/react-runtime-variables-49dc](https://dev.to/akdevcraft/react-runtime-variables-49dc)
* [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-runtime-environment-variables-with-create-react-app-docker-and-nginx-7f9d42a91d70/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-runtime-environment-variables-with-create-react-app-docker-and-nginx-7f9d42a91d70/)
* Or maybe another approach to solve this?

### Done criteria

* Make sure that the web docker is being able to build successfully
* The built docker can be run and the application can be accessed via localhost:4200 from docker
* Running the local builds from outside of docker should work as expected (pnpm start:dev)",,

1169670934,366,[NV-91] - Missing mail normalization on api tests UserSession().initialize(),"### What? 

From time to time our tests failing in the \`should change a password after reset\` test case, this is not predictable and happens from time to time. This is probably due to the fact we don't normalize the UserSession before saving it with the userRepository there.

## How to reproduce

* In the @notifire/testing library, there is a file named UserSession
* During initialization we use faker to create a random email, in some cases it might add a '.' to the request
* During token validation new perform an email normalization to omit ""+"" and dots from the email to avoid spam accounts
* You can manually add the dot to the randomized email section to probably replicate it.",,

1125155195,240,[RLD-79] - Create CLI project scaffold,"### Why?

To provide a great framework to extend from and easily maintain additional features.

### What?

Decided on an initial framework for generating a CLI project under the apps folder in the project. The cli should handle installation and usage using npx pr global npm tool. 

**Tool selection considerations**: Developer Experience, Good looking ""UI"", community support.

### Open Questions?

* What cli framework should we use? ([oclif](https://oclif.io/), [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), commander.js, [gluegun](https://github.com/infinitered/gluegun), or other good alternatives?)
* How to manage a multi-step onboarding process? And all the ""UI"" of the cli ([Inquerer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js), [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), or other alternatives).

### Outputs:

* A runnable cli command `relayed init` that outputs a HelloWorld
* Decision and guide on what cli frameworks tools to use",,
1122991052,236,[RLD-80] - Update docker files location,"## Why?

So we have more clear and more relevant root directory.

## How?

Moving the docker files from the root directory to its app folder.

For example './Dockerfile.api'

From path: ./Dockerfile.api, to: ./apps/api/Dockerfile",,
1122859859,234,[RLD-41] - Update docker-compose to use pre-built images from GHCR,"## What?
Push the images into GitHub Container Registry.

## Why?
Save time and headache from the user in building the images and thus the user will be able to get stable images version and concentrate on the deployment.

## How?
Pushing the latest version to the ghcr, and updating the docker-compose file to fetch the images from it.

",,
1119434001,228,[RLD-35] - Environment variables configuration,"
## What?

Docker env variables should be easily configurable thru a config/env file.

API_PORT
WEB_PORT
WIDGET_PORT
WS_PORT
MONGO_DB_PORT
JWT_SECRET

Service routes (API route or WS endpoints configured using docker-compose network)
",,
1112001257,219,[NV-12] - Design system integration foundations,"# Why?

Have a design system in place for reusable parts connected from baseline brand colors, typography, shadows to more higher-level components. Such a system can help iterate faster when new pages and features can reuse the lower level atoms of the design system to generate new views and components. Read more about atomic design [here](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

# Considerations

* Dark theme support

On the activity page currently, the subscriber name is lowercased, people names should be capitalized for better UX.

1106933527,183,[RLD-53] - Deploy images to DockerHub,"## Why?

Instead of building the image every time when doing docker-compose up we want to prebuilt the images so users can easily consume them without the need to rebuild everything from the stretch. 

## How?

Add build scripts for the relevant services in the root `package.json` in the following structure `build:docker:api` and etc. for each service in `docker-compose.yml` respectively.

The images should be deployed to our organizational user hosted on the `relayed` user on DockerHub.",,
1106917706,182,[RLD-51] - Add npx only-allow-pnpm to avoid people running yarn install,"## Why?

So that new contributors will know to use pnpm instead of yarn so they won't have to wait for the long `yarn install` process.

## How?

You can follow the guide from pnpm [here](https://pnpm.io/only-allow-pnpm).",,
1106395034,181,Queuing of notifications,"## What and Why?
We have a bunch of notification providers that don't provide good uptime and have to tried again and again. Need a mechanism for failure management and re-trigger notifications after a backoff. Currently I wasn't able to find a queue being persisted for the following use cases
- Bulk notifications
- Scheduled notifications
- Retrying on failure

If there is something already there, if you can point me to the relevant code sections, that would be great. Thanks.
",,
1106393035,180,Async Delivery Reports to Other Services,"## What?
Ability to send reports of delivery to an external service using a webhook.

## Why?
Extensibility to other services. 

## How?
Currently there is no way for a provider to send delivery reports to the application. Is this currently in the pipeline?

On the downstream of what to do with success/failure of a notification,
EventEmitter `postSend` can be used to handle sending this and can be processed further. Although I do thing that the config for managing webhooks for delivery reports can be part of the exiting application.

1100129630,176,[RLD-45] - Border style on window widget #176,"**Describe the bug**\
The window of the widget ([https://widget.notifire.co/K6TeacX0ig6Y](https://widget.notifire.co/K6TeacX0ig6Y)) displays an annoying border that corrupts the border radius.

**Screenshots**

[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6213171/149118496-2b65ce21-4c2a-476d-bcea-410fda5c3452.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6213171/149118496-2b65ce21-4c2a-476d-bcea-410fda5c3452.png)

**Details (please complete the following information):**

* OS: any
* Node Version: any

**Additional context**\
I noticed the simple fix it's to change to `border: 0` as in the screenshot (attached) but since the iframe CORS policy we can't do anything about it.

1097169644,173,[RLD-47] - Implement OAuth flow with GitHub,"## Why?

Allow developers to onboard quickly with their GitHub account.

## What?

GitHub OAuth flow is currently available in the code we just need to test it with some GitHub Client Id to make sure it works and creates a user correctly in the DB. The GitHub strategy is in [this file](https://github.com/notifirehq/notifire/blob/master/apps/api/src/app/auth/services/passport/github.strategy.ts) and can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/github`.

To test the auth endpoint the following env variables must be added (Create a GitHub app and the keys to the `.env` file in `apps/api/src/.env`):

```
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT=
```

## Acceptance tests

* [ ] Test the entire flow to make sure a user is created when not exist
* [ ] If a user exists make sure that he is matched and authenticates
* [ ] After authentication flow the user should be redirected to `localhost:4200` with the jwt token in the query params",,

Currently, in the admin panel, we only support SendGrid and Twilio, since the library was released to open-source the community helped build more than 14 different providers. We need a place for the user to manage credentials and discover supported providers.

# Details
- Providers are divided by channels: Email, SMS, In-app(coming soon), Push(Coming soon), Direct (Coming soon) 
- Provider can either be already implemented or coming soon, in case of coming soon we can provide details on how the user can create the provider on his own and speed the process.
- Each provider will need a different set of credentials to set up: Access Key, Secret Key, Region, API key. This part will be provider-specific.
- Single provider can be marked as ""default for channel"" in case multiple providers are specified in the same channel. ",,
1089851641,157,[Tracking] UI Onboarding,"# Why?
Currently, after the user registration, he arrives at an empty notification templates screen without any guidance on what he needs to do. To improve TTS (Time-to-Success) a new onboarding flow will be generated to facilitate and reduce the time from account creation to the first notification sent and received.

# The flow
### Account creation
- The user should be able to register with his GitHub account (if GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN is in the environment)
- The user should be able to register with email and password
- The user should create an organization (required fields: name)
- Create an application that will contain all the subscribers and templates 
- Provider a name for the application (can be defaulted to org name)
- Application type: Mobile, Web, Hybrid, Other

### Sending test notification?
- The user can see a preview of the notification center (with theme customizations?)
- Copiable `curl` command to trigger a test notification with an embedded trigger button, or wait until the user manually did the request.
- Show the real-time notification that appears and guides the user to check his email?

### Creating the first notification template
- At the empty state of the templates list provide multiple ""Get Started"" templates: Password reset, account activation, (TBD)

### Connecting providers
To send a real notification, we need to connect the user's provider for each channel: Email, SMS, (push, direct coming soon).  (Can be postponed after creating the integration store)

### Embeddable notification center integration
Depending on if the user wants to integrate the notification center, we should direct him to the ""Embed instructions flow""",,
1089788385,156,[Tracking] UI/UX improvements,"# Why?
For the upcoming alpha release, we want to uplift the current user(developer) experience in multiple areas of the already built features in the platform. We want to provide the best experience for developers that want to integrate Notifire as their notification infrastructure.


# Scope
The following areas are part of the scope for the redesign:
- Admin Panel
- Embeddable notification center widget

> ** Attached images are from actual designs needed to change

> ** In the scope of this task is mostly a visual uplift without changing the underlying business logic or adding new functionality

## Admin Panel
The biggest patch of work would be to redesign the current behavior and visual language of the admin panel, broken down by the following parts:
- Layout and navigation
- Template creation/update
- Templates list view
- Activity feed

### Layout and navigation
Updating the overall layout design of the admin panel and navigation bar including user drop down.

---

### Templates list 
**Needs to change:** 
- Updating the table component styling and CTA + and empty state for creating a new template.
- Adding column for active channels within the template

### Template Creation and update
Currently due to the complexity of the flow and future plans for expansion and new features we need to find a new way to visualize the flow in a way there will be enough air and room. For current redesign, including the current functionality with a new UX and flow.

 ### Activity feed
The goal of the activity feed is to provide a place to monitor and debug delivery across channels.

**Needs to change:** 
- In case of an error state, provide the user to have a glance at the error message delivered by the provider without the need to click on the line for further information.

1089279370,153,[RLD-48] - PNPM dependency management,"### Why?

From multiple tests, I've made [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) performs much faster than our current yarn setup.

* yarn install > `4.6 minutes`
* pnpm i > `1.6 minutes`

The main goal for this change is to reduce the setup time for new developers and our CI pipeline in which currently we spent almost 5 minutes on the install part alone.

Speaking with multiple companies doing monorepos confirmed that pnpm improves the performance and disk space 3-8x times depending on the project and the caching provided.

I've done the initial tests on the repo and created a base pnpm YAML config, but there are still things needed to be done.

### Tasks

* [X] Add missing subpackage dependencies
* [X] Update GitHub actions to use pnpm
* [X] Update docker files to use pnpm
* [X] Update documentation for bootstrapping the project
* [X] Add `npx only-allow pnpm` to avoid people running `yarn install`
* [ ] Search for other npm usages in the repository to replace with pnpm",,
1089279246,152,Allow `subject` to be passed a `function` and not only `string`,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When sending notifications we need to localize the content of the message to the target user. Currently it is only allowed for `template` to be passed as a `function` [see here](https://github.com/notifirehq/notifire/blob/ed8f6b8d85035e85aa7075b6c22e6bd3d93a5772/packages/core/src/lib/handler/email.handler.ts#L37). It is useful to be able to localize the `subject` as well.

Unfortunately the `subject` only allows a `string` to be passed which will get evaluated when the template is registered. In cases of a webserver (such as express) this is not a viable solution because the string gets evaluated as soon as it is registered.

There are several projects using `i18n` as a singleton

```js
import i18n form 'i18n';

i18n.configure({
  directory: path.join(__dirname, '../translations'),
});
```

and the language is modified on the fly when an HTTP request is made to the application. Since the template was registered on application boot the `subject` cannot be re-evaluated, making us having to create several `messages`:

```js
await notifire.registerTemplate({
    id: ""password-reset"",
    messages: [
      {
        subject: ""Your password reset request english"",
        channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL,
        template: """",
        active: (payload) => {
          return payload.language === ""en"";
        },
      },
      {
        subject: ""Your password reset request french"",
        channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL,
        template: "",
        active: (payload) => {
          return payload.language === ""fr"";
        },
      },
    ],
  });
```

Which does not use `i18n` anywhere, but more like hardcoding the values. This brings a problem when the translations are managed by a different team. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A way to register the `subject` on demand respecting changes in a dynamic app. Something like:

```js
import { getTranslation } from './plugins/i18n'

  await notifire.registerTemplate({
    id: 'password-reset',
    messages: [
      {
        subject: () => getTranslation('translation-key'),
        channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL,
        template: ""this is the awesome template"",
      },
    ],
  });
```

We could even pass the configuration of the template in here as well to evaluate something other:

```js
subject: (template: ITemplate) => {
  if (template.someFutureConfiguration === 'foo') {
    return getTranslation('translation-key-foo')
  }
  
  return getTranslation('translation-key-bar');
},

1085950207,145,[NV-43] - [Tracking] - CLI On-boarding,"## Why?

Provide an easy onboarding setup for new users using the CLI without visiting the admin panel for it. The outcome of this onboarding process is to show the developer how the product works and create an API key for him to use.

## How?

Main highlights of the cli onboarding:

* Create an application and a user account with a GitHub authentication flow
* Show the developer a demo dashboard with pre-embedded Notification Center
* Trigger the first notification from CLI to the demo dashboard and developer's email with instructions to use the admin panel.

![CLI Authentication.jpeg](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/4ba4873c-44bc-425e-89fb-3e529d8b5f10/dcee6c0f-eb15-44e4-8ce0-c76236464637)

[https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOYQPNMA=/?invite_link_id=865784997923](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOYQPNMA=/?invite_link_id=865784997923)

We can use tools such as Inquerer.js to manage the interactive parts of the onboarding process such as collecting information about the app and account.

### Application details

In the first step of the onboarding we ask for the application name of the user, this should be a string input capped to 60 characters. We will use the application name for both the application name and default organization name when creating an account to avoid collecting it twice, with a heuristic that in most cases the application name and the organization name are similar. 

### Provider selection

In this step we will provide a multi-select list with all of our providers optionally grouped by the channel type:

* SendGrid (E-mail)
* Twillio (SMS) and etc…

In this step, we will just collect the information for easily accessing and suggesting the providers to setup. 

### Authentication and API Registration

In this step, the user will be prompted to create a free account using GitHub Oauth and in phase 2 using email and password as well. 

After prompting for GitHub authentication an HTTP server needs to be created for the back redirection of the user after a successful registration.

![GitHub Oauth flow.jpeg](https://uploads.linear.app/f13f1996-c9b0-4fea-8ee7-2c3faf6a832d/995f54b0-7090-4f95-a72e-592ea128ff86/ac5e7621-a82e-4aca-aea1-0603613da002)

### Demo Dashboard

After authentication a localhost static serving server will be launched on the ephemeral port, the server will serve a static site layout with a pre-embedded notification center using the SDK embed code with a pre-populated application id and user details.

A user will be prompted to visit the localhost website on chrome. After opening the website the user will be prompted to trigger his first notification. Using instructions and code snippets with the ability to copy a curl command and paste into his terminal.

### Demo notification trigger

Using the API Key and template trigger id a new notification will be triggered and displayed to the user as a real-time push and an email sent to his registration email.

The notification CTA will contain a link to the admin panel with a token in the query to allow quick login without performing another authentication.

-  feature request

### Summary
Add a module for [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), for nice and easy usage within NestJs based code-bases.


#### Module API
The initialization module should create a notifire instance registered with providers and templates. Accessing the module at a later stage should allow adding more templates and providers at run time.

```typescript
import { NotifireModule } from ""@notifire/nest"";

@Module({
  imports: [
    NotifireModule.forRoot({
      providers: [
        new SendgridEmailProvider({
          apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
          from: ""sender@mail.com"",
        }),
      ],
      templates: [
        {
          id: ""password-reset"",
          messages: [
            {
              subject: ""Your password reset request"",
              channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL,
              template: `
          Hi {{firstName}}!
          
          To reset your password click <a href=""{{resetLink}}"">here.</a>
          
          {{#if organization}}
            <img src=""{{organization.logo}}"" />
          {{/if}}
      `,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
export class CustomerModule {}
```

### Injectable notifire instance
And `@Injectable` singleton service should be accessible in other nestjs services and modules.
```typescript
@Injectable()
class UserService {
   constructor(private notifire: Notifire) {

   }

  async triggerEvent() {
      await this.notifire.trigger(.....)
   }
}
```

The new module can be added to `packages/nest` folder. Boilerplate for the package can be taken from running `yarn run generate:provider` and then copying the folder to the packages folder.",,

1027687804,45,Describe and enforce patterns in our providers better (with TypeScript),"- **I'm submitting a ...**
 [ ] bug report
 [x] feature request
 [x] question about the decisions made in the repository
 [ ] question about how to use this project

- **Summary**
While using the project, I noticed that there are a few places where the typing information could be better. Enforcing some patterns is also possible by providing an abstract class to derive from, for example. Just wanted to bring these ideas up for discussion.

- **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stack traces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. StackOverflow, personal fork, etc.)
I want to talk about a few things, so let me add numbers as a way to refer to the ideas:

I'm providing code context here so people can contribute to this issue/discussion without having to go through source.
```typescript
export interface IProvider {
  id: string;
  channelType: ChannelTypeEnum;
}

export interface IEmailOptions {
  to: string | string[];
  subject: string;
  html: string;
  from?: string;
  text?: string;
}

export interface ISmsOptions {
  to: string;
  content: string;
  from?: string;
}

export interface IEmailProvider extends IProvider {
  channelType: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL;

  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  sendMessage(options: IEmailOptions): Promise<any>;
}

export interface ISmsProvider extends IProvider {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  sendMessage(options: ISmsOptions): Promise<any>;

  channelType: ChannelTypeEnum.SMS;
}
```
1. Our `Provider`s are always tied to the `ChannelTypeEnum`. We could write the definition as:
```typescript
export interface IProvider<C extends ChannelTypeEnum> {
  channelType: C;
}
export interface IEmailProvider extends IProvider<ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL> {
  sendMessage(options: IEmailOptions): Promise<any>;
}
```

2. In general, none of the properties of the provider and even options are supposed to be writable. so we could add [`readonly`](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/readonly#readonly) attributes to all properties so that it's clear and consumers of the API (at least in TypeScript) can't make mistakes like changing the channel type of a provider or the to address of an `IEmailOptions`.
```typescript
export interface IProvider {
  readonly channelType: ChannelTypeEnum;
}
export interface ISmsOptions {
  readonly to: string;
  readonly content: string;
  readonly from?: string;
}
```
Another way to use records like `ISmsOptions` is to [control consumers](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/readonly#readonly-1) from not being able to edit them:
```typescript
export interface ISmsProvider extends IProvider {
  sendMessage(options: Readonly<ISmsOptions>): Promise<any>;
}
```

3. Provide a standard interface for configurations. As an example, in the PR #44 we have an `EmailJsConfig` interface:
```typescript
export interface EmailJsConfig {
  from: string;
  host: string;
  port: number;
  secure: boolean;
  user: string;
  password: string;
}
```
We could provide an interface for API-based and SMTP-based email providers so that the shape of the configuration is consistent.
```typescript
export interface EmailProviderConfig {
}
export interface SmtpBasedEmailProviderConfig extends EmailProviderConfig {
  from: string;
  host: string;
  port: number;
  secure: boolean;
  user: string;
  password: string;
}
export interface EmailJsConfig extends SmtpBasedEmailProviderConfig {
}
export interface NodeMailerConfig extends SmtpBasedEmailProviderConfig {
}
export interface ApiBasedEmailProviderConfig extends EmailProviderConfig {
  api_key: string;
}
export interface SendgridConfig extends ApiBasedEmailProviderConfig {
}
```
4. Provide easy ways to enforce patterns with `IProvider` implementations.

For example, if we want to enforce usage of EmailProviderConfig, we can expose an abstract class for the same:
```typescript
public abstract class ConfigBasedEmailProvider<E extends EmailProviderConfig> {
  constructor(protected config: E) {
  }
}
```
That would enable writing new config based providers easily. For example, the EmailJsProvider could've been written as:
```typescript
public class EmailJsProvider extends ConfigBasedEmailProvider<EmailJsConfig> implements IEmailProvider {
  ..
}
```

5. ~I would discourage returning `Promise<any>` - but I'd like to first understand why it's used. I think in most instances of current usage it can safely be `Promise<void>` if we don't care about the result but want to signal an `async` operation. Returning an any is pretty useless as the result always needs to be casted. Converting a result this way can be done by something like `promise().then(() => {})`. Combining this with idea 4 would mean we don't even need individual providers to write this code. They can return `Promise<T>` and we can always ensure the final return is a `Promise<void>`.~ Already taken care of in #41 

6. Some interfaces which are closed, could just be [type aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#interfaces-vs-type-aliases). Example:
```typescript
type SmsOptions = {
  to: string;
  content: string;
  from?: string;
}
```
because we don't expect the options to be extended, whereas `EmailProviderConfig` in idea 3 is expected to be extended.

These ideas are composable. For example, combining the ideas 1, 3, and 4, we can write the EmailJsProvider as
```typescript
public abstract class ConfigBasedEmailProvider<E extends EmailProviderConfig> implements IProvider<ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL> {
  channelType: ChannelTypeEnum.EMail;
  constructor(protected config: E) {
 }
  abstract sendMessage(options: IEmailOptions): Promise<any>;
}
public class EmailJsProvider extends ConfigBasedEmailProvider<EmailJsConfig> {
  ..
}
```
Notice the lack of `readonly` since we didn't use idea 2.

These were my initial thoughts. Please let me know what you think.",,
