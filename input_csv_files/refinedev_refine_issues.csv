2691138622,6519,[BUG] wrong return type of `useOne`,"### Describe the bug

The type of `data` in the following code is `GetOneResponse<BaseRecord>`, but actually it should not be

```
import { useOne } from ""@refinedev/core"";
const { data } = useOne();`
```

Now the typings say that `data` has another entry with key `data` inside. This is not true.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Use `useOne`
2. The typing is wrong: `ReturnType<typeof useOne<T>>['data']` is `T` in reality and not `GetOneResponse<T>` as indicated by the typing

### Expected behavior

`ReturnType<typeof useOne<T>>['data']` should be `T`

It would be great to have a variants prop for the sidebar, providing out-of-the-box styles inspired by popular platforms like Gmail, Outlook, or other well-known websites.

2678925836,6513,[BUG] Create Button `@refinedev/mui`  onClick still works when `disabled` prop is applied,"### Describe the bug

The bug happens because the component doesn’t properly use the provided props on the following lines: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/716123cad4c2ef8d2ab1907f8abe1fea48fcdd00/packages/mui/src/components/buttons/create/index.tsx#L48

Instead of relying on `useCreateButton().disabled`, `<Button />` and `<LinkComponent />` should use the following code:

```typescript
const isDisabled = disabled || rest.disabled;
```

This issue likely exists in the other UI packages as well (@refinedev/antd, @refinedev/mantine, @refinedev/chakra-ui), and they should be updated accordingly as part of this fix.

See above.",2488314281,"@aress31 thanks for the issue. We've discussed this one and decided to accept `onSiderCollapsed` function to [ThemedLayoutV2](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/antd/src/components/themedLayoutV2/index.tsx) component.

Then `onSiderCollapsed` will be passed to [ThemedLayoutContextProvider](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/antd/src/contexts/themedLayoutContext/index.tsx)

Here, we should replace existing `setSiderCollapsed` with a wrapper, where we call setSiderCollapsed state action and also `onSiderCollapsed` coming from user.

Here is a pseudo implementation:

This will allow users to persist their collapsed state into localstorage in `onSiderCollapsed` method. And then users can read this from localStorage and pass initial value `initialSiderCollapsed` from here.

We need to do these changes in ThemedLayoutV2 component for
- Ant Design
- Material UI
- Mantine
- Chakra UI

They all have almost exact same code, so it should be straightforward to implement.

We are open to contributions for this one.

I am using typescript, and I am passing an empty string as the id, something like this:
```typescript

```
and typescript allowed it...
The problem is probably because `!""""` evaluates to `true` then the ""missing id"" error is thrown.
I am using an empty string because in strapi-v4 data provider the id part of the api requests is empty, then then the path ends with `...<resource>/` and it works with the single types rest api paths of strapi.
The possible solution might be checking for null/undefined value in this if statement...

              paddingTop: hideForm ? ""15dvh"" : 0,
            }}
          >
```

These styles should be as much as possible be integrated to the wrapping `<Box component=""div"" style={layoutStyles} {...(wrapperProps ?? {})}>` so that the customisation of the outer Container is possible.

### Steps To Reproduce

### Additional Context

_No response_",2483095573,"Hello @aress31, you have valid points, but we don't believe <AuthPage /> needs to be fully customized. It currently works well and is sufficient for starting a new project. While implementing <AuthPage />, we considered those who wouldn’t want to spend time on a login mechanism in the first weeks of a new project. Each app may have its unique design language and allowing this level of customization would make things overly complex. Also, `<AuthPage />` can be [swizzled](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/cli/#commands) and customized for small adjustments as needed.

However, if you’d like to work on this issue, we’re open to all contributions! I’m closing the issue for now, but feel free to reopen it if you decide to implement this."

2666824722,6497,[BUG] Breadcumbs Only Work on N2 Level,"### Describe the bug

It appears that the breadcrumb component doesn't display anything when the array contains only a single element. This undermines the consistency of the layout, as I would like to maintain a consistent breadcrumb style across all pages, even when there is only one breadcrumb item. Could you kindly add a property to define the minimum number of elements required for the breadcrumb to be displayed?

### Steps To Reproduce

```js
import { Toolbar } from ""@mui/material"";
import { useBreadcrumb } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { Breadcrumb, ThemedLayoutV2 } from ""@refinedev/mui"";
import { Outlet } from ""react-router-dom"";

_No response_",2488156514,"We discussed with the core team and decided that the implementation would be better as follows:

1. `<Breadcrumb />` should take a new prop as `minItems`(or better name) and the [breadcrumbs.length === 1](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/mui/src/components/breadcrumb/index.tsx#L44) check should be compared with this new prop.

2. new prop's type should be added to [@refinedev/ui-types](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/ui-types/src/types/breadcrumb.tsx#L1)
```ts
/** 
* Minimum number of breadcrumb items required for rendering. Component won't render if items * are less than this number. 
*/
minItems?: number;
```
3. All UI packages should be updated
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/mui/src/components/breadcrumb
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/core/src/hooks/breadcrumb
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/antd/src/components/breadcrumb
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/mantine/src/components/breadcrumb
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/chakra-ui/src/components/breadcrumb

4. All tests should be updated. If possible, it should be implemented in the `@refinedev/ui-tests` package; otherwise, it can be implemented in the package's own test file.

5. All documentation should be updated.


I’d also like to point out that `<Breadcrumb />` can be globally configurable by passing a prop to the `<Refine />` component.

2661126912,6493,[BUG] @refinedev/graphql Error Handling does not work as it should,"### Describe the bug

Refine's GraphQL package is loosely based on nestjs-query. However, uses urql under the hood. urql uses 2 different types of error handling mechanisms, an errorExchange in exchanges or response.error on the result. The way refine is built using Tanstack query it is expecting an exception **new Error** to be thrown in order to be caught and treated as an error. But urql does not do this out of the box, and so refine always treats any error as a success, which impact the notifications provider.

### Steps To Reproduce

Create a new project using the GraphQL dataProvider with the below dataProvider.tsx file

My apologies for the badly formatted codeblock below. Could not get markdown to work correctly.
```ts
import { Client, OperationResult, fetchExchange, errorExchange } from ""urql"";
import createDataProvider from ""@refinedev/graphql"";
export const API_BASE_URL = ""http://localhost:5000"";
export const API_URL = `${API_BASE_URL}/graphql`;

// This is the global error handling process
const customErrorExchange = errorExchange({
  onError: (error) => {
    let errorMsg = """";

    if (error.networkError) {
      errorMsg = ""Network error: Please check your internet connection."";
    }

    if (error.graphQLErrors) {
      // Create a combined message for all GraphQL errors
      const message = error.graphQLErrors
        .map(({ message }) => message)
        .join("", "");
      errorMsg = message;
    }
    
    console.log(errorMsg);
    throw new Error(errorMsg); //this does not work
    throw Promise.reject(new Error(errorMsg)); //this does not work as it says Uncaught in Promise
    
  },
});

export const client = new Client({
  url: API_URL,
  exchanges: [customErrorExchange, fetchExchange]
});

export const dataProvider = createDataProvider(client);
```

All of the error handling above gives an **Uncaught (in promise)**

### Expected behavior

Since refine is using urql, the way that it should behave would be to catch the error in the @refinedev/graphql dataprovider class and throw the error there, like it does at 

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/961e1fea5e505d133d735bd99111eb26c61f1186/packages/graphql/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L20

urql provides this error back so it is easy to catch and rethrow by adding in a handler function as below

```ts
const errorHandler = (error : CombinedError | undefined): string => {
  let errorMsg = """";

  if (error?.networkError) errorMsg = ""error.networkerror"";

  if (error?.graphQLErrors) {
      const message = error.graphQLErrors
          .map(({ message }) => message)
          .join("", "");
    errorMsg = message;
  }
  
  return errorMsg
}
```

or any other line where the error could come back from the server.
Add in 

`if (response.error) throw new Error(errorHandler(response.error));`

2660391902,6492,[BUG] Redirect Doesn't Work with `useForm` following the docs,"### Describe the bug

I get this error when trying to add redirect on a `useForm`

```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'redirect' does not exist in type 'UseFormProps<BaseRecord, HttpError, FieldValues, {}, BaseRecord, BaseRecord, HttpError>'.ts(2353)

    refineCore: { onFinish },

    handleSubmit,

### Additional Context

Was trying to follow the tutorial here https://refine.dev/tutorial/routing/redirects/react-router/#showing-the-record-after-update",2478091623,"Hello @daninus14, 

In the tutorial, we use `useForm` from ""**@refinedev/core**"", but if you want to use it from ""**@refinedev/react-hook-form**"", the API might be a bit different.

To make it work, you need to pass the [`redirect`](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/react-hook-form/use-form/#redirect) prop like this:

```tsx
import { useForm } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";

useForm({
  refineCoreProps: {
    redirect: false,
  },
});
```

Sorry for the confusion. The name `refineCoreProps` is different because `@refinedev/react-hook-form` internally uses the core functionality from `@refinedev/core`. To pass specific options or configurations to the core, these are grouped under the `refineCoreProps` property.

2654854055,6489,[BUG] Docker build fails,"### Describe the bug

Building refine app for production in docker gets stuck for dozens of minutes

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Dockerize refine application
2. Run docker build for Dockerfile specified in refinedev github repo
3. Wait till the process goes to row RUN npm run build
4. Build is completed in several seconds (app. 30 seconds)
5. After that, build is stuck for 15 minutes

The whole application build and deployment is part of a CICD pipeline defined in GitLab. Docker images are built using kaniko. Every time a build is executed, a new build container is spawned where the Dockerfile instructions are being executed by kaniko. 

The application finishes the build phase (in app. 30 seconds) with the following output:

2. When I log in as a restricted-access user, I expect for my initial route, set by `<NavigateToResource />`, to be the first resource I have access to. Instead, I am redirected to a route to which I do _not_ have access, because it's using the same `useResource()` list that is not filtered by accessControl.
3. An explicit `<CanAccess>` wrapper around pages _does_ work correctly.

1. I have a `Menu` component, pretty much identical to the template's, that uses `useMenu` to build the left-hand menu. I expect for the menu items to be a list of resources filtered by accessControlProvider's `can` method. Instead, I see all resources without filtering.
2. When I log in as a restricted-access user, I expect for my initial route, set by `<NavigateToResource />`, to be the first resource I have access to. Instead, I am redirected to a route to which I do _not_ have access, because it's using the same `useResource()` list that is not filtered by accessControl.
3. An explicit `<CanAccess>` wrapper around pages _does_ work correctly.

Digging through the code, I do not see any mechanism or check for `accessControlProvider.can` to filter the resources. I'm not sure how this is supposed to work - short of me reimplementing everything built on top of `useResource()`?

@BatuhanW Yes, see my description in the OP. `<CanAccess />` works for me at the page level, unfortunately what I'm asking about here  is not the page-level access control, but rather the layout-level navigation elements that are independent of the specific page, such as `<NavMenu />` which gets its content from `useMenu` and ultimately `useResource`, which _should_ but apparently does _not_ filter the elements based on `useCan`."

_No response_",2476894899,"@BatuhanW I am not finding much use for the `accessControlProvider` pattern as currently designed, because I'm not in control of the caching, and adding an additional cache layer as you recommend doesn't make much sense. I'd much rather just use React Query, so I probably will. I can trivially implement `useCan` and `CanAccess` on top of RQ. It sounds like `accessControlProvider` doesn't actually give much, because it doesn't work out of the box to filter `useMenu` or many other hooks that rely on `useResource`. The example @alicanerdurmaz gives above is precisely what I was hoping to avoid - _manually_ filtering the resources wherever I need to read them. Its support seems very partial and indeed it isn't compatible with many otherwise recommended components like `NavigateToResource`. So, I will be forgoing it for now. Looking forward to deeper support in the future. Thanks for answering my questions though!"

1. I have a `Menu` component, pretty much identical to the template's, that uses `useMenu` to build the left-hand menu. I expect for the menu items to be a list of resources filtered by accessControlProvider's `can` method. Instead, I see all resources without filtering.
2. When I log in as a restricted-access user, I expect for my initial route, set by `<NavigateToResource />`, to be the first resource I have access to. Instead, I am redirected to a route to which I do _not_ have access, because it's using the same `useResource()` list that is not filtered by accessControl.
3. An explicit `<CanAccess>` wrapper around pages _does_ work correctly.

Digging through the code, I do not see any mechanism or check for `accessControlProvider.can` to filter the resources. I'm not sure how this is supposed to work - short of me reimplementing everything built on top of `useResource()`?

You can use that sider, which does it for you. Am I missing something? You are assuming useResource hook will not list, but useResource hook has much more use cases than that. We can't put AC there. 

By the way, access control provider's can method is already cached, also can be configured. What I meant was fetching available list items outside the can method. You can check it here: https://refine.dev/docs/authorization/access-control-provider/#performance"

_No response_",2487863935,"Directly adding the access control feature to `<NavigateToResource />` is not ideal, as we aim to keep Refine as atomic as possible and provide users complete freedom without imposing any opinions. Instead, users can wrap `<NavigateToResource />` with `<CanAccess />` to handle access control, as shown below: 

```tsx
import { NavigateToResource } from ""@refinedev/react-router-v6"";
import { Navigate } from ""react-router-dom"";

<CanAccess resource=""posts"" action=""list"" fallback={<Navigate to=""/"" />}>

By offering atomic components and hooks like `useCan` and `<CanAccess />`, we allow users to manage access control in a way that best suits their needs."

_No response_",2489108976,"@alicanerdurmaz the use case I have in mind is precisely the one where we do _not_ have a specific resource, but instead need to navigate the user to the appropriate landing page given the access control they have. I'm not blocked by this as I've implemented it on my own. I do not think it is essential that `<NavigateToResource>` must use access control, but the access control support for basic use cases like mine IMO is incomplete, and Refine could use a story on what to do - not that component perhaps, but which? what _is_ the recommended technique for handling such common scenarios?"

### Describe the thing to improve

As you can see in the above code in the clientside section I have code that edits the URL in the browser and tries to make a priceRange selector thing:

  ```tsx

const Home = ({
  initialCategories,
  initialResults,
  initialCategory,
  initialQuery,
}: Props) => {
//  ...
const updatePriceRange = (newRange: number[]) => {
    setPriceRange(newRange);
    // Update the URL with new min and max prices
    router.push(
      {
        pathname: router.pathname,

  const handleMinPriceChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {

    const newMax = Math.max(Number(e.target.value), priceRange[0] + 1);
    updatePriceRange([priceRange[0], newMax]);
  };

```
and also note that on clientside I am arleady **_TRYING mY BEST_** to filter the results:
  
```tsx
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const newFilteredResults: typeof initialResults = [];
  
    // Using forEach to populate newFilteredResults based on price range
    initialResults.forEach((product) => {
      //console.warn(product)
      const price = product.variants[0]?.calculated_price;
      //console.warn(price)
      if (price >= priceRange[0] && price <= priceRange[1]) {
        newFilteredResults.push(product);
      }
    });
    //console.warn(newFilteredResults)
    setFilteredResults(newFilteredResults);
  }, [priceRange, initialResults]);
//...
//and then I pass them to here
      queryOptions: {
        initialData:
          searchQuery === initialQuery &&
          selectedCategoryId === initialCategory
            ? filteredResults //<-------- SEE HOW I PASS THEM FILTERED???? IT DONT WORK FOR SOME REASON
            : undefined,
        keepPreviousData: false,
        select: (response) => {
          // Assuming the actual data array is inside response.data
          const sortedData = response.data.sort(hsCodeSorter);
          return {
            ...response,
            data: sortedData,
          };
        },
      },
```
But it dont work simply working with the initialResults on clientside no matter how I change the priceRange values it won't filter them the way I want.
So I tried working on serverSide:

```tsx

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<Props> = async (
  context,
) => {
  const { query } = context;
  const { category = undefined, q = undefined, minPrice = ""0"", maxPrice = ""1000"" } = query;
  
  const minPriceNumber = parseInt(minPrice as string, 10) || 0;
  const maxPriceNumber = parseInt(maxPrice as string, 10) || 1000;
  console.log(""PRICES BETWEEN ""+minPriceNumber+"" AND ""+maxPriceNumber)
```
...
```tsx
      console.log(newFilteredResults)
      console.log(minPriceNumber)
      console.log(maxPriceNumber)
      newFilteredResults.forEach((product) => {
        const price = product.variants[0]?.calculated_price;
        console.log(""PP is"" + price)
      })
    return {
      props: {
        initialResults: newFilteredResults,
        initialCategories: categories,
        ...(q && { initialQuery: q as string }),
        ...(category && { initialCategory: category as string }),
      },
    };
```
According to my console.log's in clientSide alone, the priceFiltering should work, but visually I'm seeing all products the same. 
And serverSide section the console.log ""PP is""+price only prints the filtered products, so the serverside also works BUT on UI I see all products, not only the filtered products.
What am I doing wrong?


### Describe the solution (optional)


I also have another clientSide implementation that I don't know how to make work:

```js
    const updatePriceRange = React.useMemo(
      () => (newRange: number[]) => {
        setPriceRange(newRange);
        router.push(
          {
            pathname: router.pathname,
            query: {
              ...router.query,
              minPrice: newRange[0],
              maxPrice: newRange[1],
            },
          },
          undefined,
          { shallow: true }
        );
        setFilters((prevFilters) => [
          ...prevFilters.filter(
            (filter) => filter.field !== ""variants.calculated_price""
          ),
          { field: ""variants.calculated_price"", operator: ""gte"", value: newRange[0] },
          { field: ""variants.calculated_price"", operator: ""lte"", value: newRange[1] },
        ], ""replace"");
      },
      [router, setFilters]
    );

```
how do I make it access product.variants.calculated_price I dont think the way I implemented it it works good for medusajs data structure because it must access object within object or smth like this?

2637465439,6463,[BUG] `<Link />` component ref type is too restrictive,"### Describe the bug

The [`<Link />`](https://refine.dev/docs/routing/components/link/) component’s ref type is set to `HTMLAnchorElement` only, which means it can’t be used with other types of elements. This makes it hard to use with custom components or different HTML elements.

### Steps To Reproduce

 This will cause a type error

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  return <Link ref={ref} to=""/posts"" />;
};
```

### Expected behavior

The `<Link />` component should accept refs of any valid element type

2635095346,6458,[BUG] useForm from `refinedev/react-hook-form` incorrectly checks `autoSave`,"### Describe the bug

- I used the useForm from `@refinedev/react-hook-form` while specifying the autoSave.enabled to `false` and yet it autoSaves. 
- I then noticed that if unspecified it works as autoSave false because that is the default.
- In my case, I'd like to explicitly define it as false without having to do this:

```tsx

The issue I’m encountering is that when I use useList or useDataGrid, the filters defined in resources don’t seem to apply automatically. Instead, these functions retrieve the entire table data unless I explicitly set filters in the function call.

I've searched the documentation extensively, but haven’t found a solution. I want to keep all filtering logic centralized within the resources configuration, as it's specific to each resource.

The filters should be detected and applied when synWithLocation is turned on.

2630900618,6450,[BUG]Infinite Rendering on List View with useTable in Next.js App Routing,"### Describe the bug

I was trying to create a list view following the example of useTable. However, when I load the page, it renders infinitely.

The issue seems to be that tableQuery's fetchStatus remains in the ""fetching"" state. However, there is no call to the data provider's getList action, and tableQuery.data remains undefined, resulting in no data being displayed.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set up a list view using useTable following the usage example in the documentation.
2. Implement this in a Next.js project using app routing.
3. Load the list view page.
4. Observe the page entering an infinite rendering loop.

### Expected behavior

Data should be fetched from the data provider and displayed in the table. The page should render once with the fetched data.

There are a few use cases that `useMany` does not currently seem to support, specifically:

1. **Conditional Rendering:**

  ```js
  const DataGridView = () => {
    const supabaseColumns = useSupabaseColumns();
    const { dataGridProps } = useDataGrid();
  
    const [query, setQuery] = useState({ resource: """", ids: [] });
  
    useEffect(() => {
      const resources = supabaseColumns
        .filter((column) => column.foreign_key_reference)
        .map(({ column_name }) => `${column_name.split(""_"")[0]}s`);
  
      const query = resources.map((resource) => {
        const supabaseColumn = `${resource.slice(0, -1)}_id`;
        return {
          resource,
          ids: dataGridProps.rows.map((row) => row[supabaseColumn]),
        };
      })[0];
  
      setQuery(query);
    }, [dataGridProps.rows, supabaseColumns]);
  
    console.log({ query, dataGridProps });
  
    const { data } = useMany({
      ...query,
      queryOptions: { enabled: query.resource !== """" },
    });
  
    console.log({ data });
  
    return (
      <DataGridComponent
        columns={generateColumnDefinitions(supabaseColumns)}
        dataGridProps={dataGridProps}
      />
    );
  };
  ```

In this scenario, I want to trigger `useMany` only when there is a column with a foreign key. I have attempted to adjust the hooks, but this particular use case does not seem to be supported yet.

2. **Support for Query Arrays:** It would be beneficial to allow the passing of an array of queries, which would in turn return an array of data. This enhancement would improve efficiency and the developer experience.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. **Look at the Code:** Check out the `DataGridView` component where `useMany` is used.
2. **Check the query State:** See how query gets set based on the foreign key columns.
3. **Run It:** Render the component and watch the console for query and `dataGridProps`.
4. **Change Foreign Keys:** Play around with the data to see how `useMany` reacts when there are no foreign key columns.

### Expected behavior

The `useMany` hook should only run when certain conditions are met, like having foreign key columns or valid resource identifiers. This helps avoid unnecessary API calls when there's nothing relevant to fetch, making the app faster and smoother. Plus, it would be awesome to support an array of queries to grab multiple related resources at once, which would make data fetching even more efficient.

```js

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './router' in 'D:\Github\cronus\src\configs'
Did you mean 'index.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request './router' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '""type"": ""module""').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.

Ive been digging into the resource system and one thing I have noticed is that providers like simple-rest take the resource id as-is for building a url. However we have 

```
export interface IResourceComponents {
  list?: ResourceRouteComposition;
  create?: ResourceRouteComposition;
  clone?: ResourceRouteComposition;
  edit?: ResourceRouteComposition;
  show?: ResourceRouteComposition;

It would make a lot more sense if allow the data provider to do so, so that we can better organize the API paths.

I have recently discovered a vite configuration issue that I fixed that prevented sourcemaps for refine core from working (I have had a lot of issues before then). However, even with this, is seems at-least 1 code path while debugging skipped an if statement based on the if for no reason at all.

I am requesting the project consider disabling minify in builds so that pages can properly be debugged without needing to jump through hoops as building locally, creating a patch and use pnpm or patch-package is honestly a last resort type of PITA. This to be clear, is so debugging can happen without sourcemaps since I have found they are not always perfect.

Additionally if minify is really considered valuable for a reason I don't need or don't agree with, create a new package export on packages for a different variation.

As I see it minify optimization should be the job of a bundler and npm code should not be pre-minified. It has been a pet peeve of mind as well when i come across this.

It is very simple: I am building a medusajs store based on the medusa V1 api, using the SWAG template, and I am trying to edit the SWAG store template which you have developed to work +/- OK on medusajs V1 api.

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/store

I have had to mod some files so far, and all of them are in the tsx files, which is easy to develop for, But the issue I am encountering is that there are some things that aren't so straightforward to edit:

I am in refine/examples/store/pages/_app.tsx 

and there is this originally
```

 ...
 return (
    <ManagedUIContext>
      <GitHubBanner />
      <main className={clsx(inter.variable, ""font-sans"", ""bg-gray-lightest"")}>
        <Refine
...

```

this github banner is baked in a core module somewhere, which I must edit (No, I DO NOT WANT to create my custom files for this, I like the banner as is, I just want to edit the text and link that appears, so I had to edit the mjs files and created custom banners there).

I am trying to reuse it for ""Free shipping on orders above N euros"" and I am making it multilanguage because poor medusajs doesnt support multilang in the traditional way so I have to code it from scratch. 

Here is what I am doing right now:

```

    // Get user's browser language if no relevant cookie is found
    const userLang = cookieLang || navigator.language;
    if (userLang.startsWith(""pt"")) {
      setGitHubBannerComponent(<GitHubBannerPt />);
    } else if (userLang.startsWith(""es"")) {
      setGitHubBannerComponent(<GitHubBannerEs />);
    } else {
      setGitHubBannerComponent(<GitHubBanner />);
    }

    //... some irrelevant code

  }, []);

  const renderComponent = () => {
    if (Component.noLayout) {
      return <Component {...pageProps} />;
    }

    return (
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    );
  };

  return (
    <ManagedUIContext>
      {GitHubBannerComponent} {/* Display the correct GitHubBanner based on language */}
      <main className={clsx(inter.variable, ""font-sans"", ""bg-gray-lightest"")}>

```

basically what I am asking for is to make it easier to edit, I don't want to unminify mjs files to edit some simple html/css - makes sense? 
If you have ever modded or written PHP/HTML/CSS you know how easy it is. 
This is something I code on top of my head, that reads https://url.com/index.php?Theme=Dark || Pink || Unset to show how easy something like this MUST be:
```

<html>
<head>
<?php 

if ($_GET['Theme']==""Dark"") {
?>
<style>
html {
background:black
}
</style>
<title>DarkVersion</title>

elseif ($_GET['Theme']==""Pink"")

Looks like it's a react query dependency issue. I upgraded all modules to the most current version and they still don't work. What could be the fix and what version of react query does refine require?

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to any listing page, which has a delete button
2. The error shows.

### Expected behavior

Not to throw an error.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Install Bun from bun.sh on Windows with `powershell -c ""irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex""`
2. Attempt to create a new Refine project with `bun create refine-app@latest`
3. The message with the cow saying `CRUD apps so sleek, even the cows want in! Let's get mooo-ving with Refine!` shows up but then nothing else happens and the script stops.

### Expected behavior

The scripts should continue with the setup process just as in other package managers or operating systems.

2571656990,6395,[BUG] queryOptions has extra type baggage that's unnecessary with ReactQuery,"### Describe the bug

Look at the types at https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/0842b702dad2c95966b2a2b49da0a66527bcbea3/packages/core/src/hooks/show/types.ts#L54C1-L58

```ts
  queryOptions?: UseQueryOptions<
    GetOneResponse<TQueryFnData>,
    TError,
    GetOneResponse<TData>
  >;
```

They should be:

```ts
  queryOptions?: UseQueryOptions<
    TQueryFnData,
    TError,
    TData
  >;
```

(This also applies elsewhere to `useTable` and other hooks with a `queryOptions` property)

The problem with the former is they are inconsistent with how ReactQuery defines query types.

For example, if I implement `queryOptions.queryFn`, It won't accept an API that returns type `TQueryFnData`, insisting that it's wrapped in a `{ data: TQueryFnData }` container. However, in ReactQuery, you just return `TQueryFnData` from `queryFn` and ReactQuery itself owns the metadata/lifecycle container, wrapping the returned value in a `QueryObserverBaseResult` which contains a `{ data: TQueryFnData }` property.

As a consequence, the result object is doubly wrapped: `{ data: { data: TQueryFnData }}`!

I can work around this by wrapping the response in a redundant `GetOneResponse`, but this should not be necessary. It would be better if the double wrapping were removed.

### Steps To Reproduce

Implement `queryOptions.queryFn` using options that work in a plain `useQuery` invocation

### Expected behavior

Use of ReactQuery should be a thin wrapper that works along with existing knowledge of the ReactQuery APIs

2564824556,6385,[BUG] setFilters from useDataGrid causes infinite loop inside useEffects,"### Describe the bug

I was trying to use the `setFilters` from the useDataGrid hook in a custom debounce function that are attached with a state. I have something very simple like:
```
useEffect(() => {
    setFilters(
      [
        {
          field: ""id"",
          value: debouncedSearchInput,
          operator: ""eq"",
        },
      ],
      ""replace""
    );
  }, [debouncedSearchInput, search,  setFilters]);
```

The code above is causing a infinite loop. After investigate a bit I realised that inside the `useTable` hook the `setFiltersFn` are not wrapped in a `useCallback` and this causing changes in states changes the reference of the function and bc of that it's impossible pass the `setFilters` as a dependency.

The fix is quite easy, I can open a PR for fixing it.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. get the `setFilters` from `useDataGrid`
2. use it in a useEffect and pass setFilters as a dependency.
3. infinite loop

### Expected behavior

Use setFilters as a dependency should not cause infinite loop

Most data providers use of Axios which is considered deprecated by (many/some). See [adios-axios](https://www.adios-axios.com/). Nowadays Native Fetch APIs are widely supported by all big browsers. A thin wrapper like `KY` provides an easy API to make use of functionalities like interceptors.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

Axios was once a convenient library that utilized [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) in web browsers and the [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module in Node environments. However, in today's modern development landscape, this approach has been surpassed by the native Fetch API, which offers consistent functionality across browsers, Node, and even other environments.

With the adoption of a unified API like Fetch, you can easily eliminate Axios as an additional dependency in your modern codebase, resulting in reduced bundle sizes. Moreover, the Fetch API has undergone full standardization, unlike Axios, which comes with its own set of nuances that often catch developers off-guard. This includes differences in how fetch and Axios handle promise rejection in various scenarios.

Furthermore, certain frameworks, like Next.js, have begun exposing additional features within the Fetch API that may not be readily accessible when using Axios.

2555171344,6377,[BUG] Queries are not responding to URL parameter changes,"### Discussed in https://github.com/refinedev/refine/discussions/6318

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **TomCaserta** September 11, 2024</sup>
Essentially I'm reading over the multitenancy documentation https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/multi-tenancy/ and I've implemented what it suggests:

1. Route parameter called `:tenantId`
2. My data provider uses the `tenantId` found in the meta and sends it to my endpoints via a header

The issue seems to be when I replace the tenantId parameter in the URL it doesn't actually reload the data. 

After looking at the examples it seems it uses the params and the tenant ID as a filter parameter in the multi tenancy strapi example.

This seems to be different to the suggested approach and of course works in that scenario as the param changing causes the query key to change as the filters are changing. As far as I can tell the meta (combinedMeta) is not taken into consideration in the `useList` query key creation, is this intentional?:

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/core/src/hooks/data/useList.ts#L238

Is there any way to make this work using route parameters and without specifying a filter on every usage of a useList/useOne/useMany hook?</div>

### Proposed Fix

When generating query and mutation keys, `combinedMeta` should be used instead of `preferredMeta`. This case needs to be done for every data hook to be consistent. A related test case needs to be added.",,

2528514908,6340,[BUG] Filters cannot be multiple of the same field and operator,"### Describe the bug

When adding multiple filters, it is not possible to create a filter with the same field and operator twice. It is really vague why this has even been decided. 


Some scenarios where this doesn't make sense are:
I want to filter on a name not being equal to Tom and also not being equal to John. 
I want to filter on dates and have two dates that I do not want to be added to the result set.

Currently these filters are not possible because refine either merges or replaces any fields that have the same field and operator. 


### Steps To Reproduce

1. Ensure that you use a UI library that allows multiple filters, I used MUI DataGrid Pro and filter on the back-end
2. Ensure that filter history is persisted on refreshes in for example the URL by setting syncWithLocation: true
3. Add two filters with the same field and with the same operator
4. Change something in filter 1
5. Change something in filter 2
6. Refresh

The filters are not persisted even with syncLocation. There is a very buggy state as filter 2 points to the same state value as filter 1. It seems that refine is not configured to work with multiple filters with the same operator like this yet. 

### Expected behavior

Both filters to be executed and the back-end should simply be handling this as this filter is valid.

Best",,
2524155596,6329,[FEAT] Create a `<Link />` component to navigate to a given resource.,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I want to navigate to the list page of the `posts` resource, to do that I need to do something like this:

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { Link } from ""react-router-dom"";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const { listUrl } = useNavigation();

  return <Link to={listUrl(""posts"")}>Go to posts list</Link>;
};
```

It would be easier to use if the `<Link />` component accepts `resource` as a prop and resolves the path automatically.


### Describe the thing to improve

The `<Link />` component can take a `go` prop and use `useGo` to create the path. This way, I can use all `useGo` features and easily handle resource links.

```tsx
import { Link } from ""@refinedev/core"";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Link
      go={{
        to: {

2522177055,6326,[FEAT] Notification types,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

It's not possible to make a simple plain notification (in typescript) because useNotification requires `type: ""success"" | ""error"" | ""progress""`.

A plain notification would be needed when displaying a message or information. 

It seems like the type restriction actually only is in the type definition.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Adding `// @ts-expect-error type` before the property makes it possible to override the value with any string. Omitting the `type` property or setting the `type` property to an empty string `""""` seems to make a simple plain notification. Setting the `type` to `""warning""` or `""info""` seems to work fine as well. 

```ts
const { open } = useNotification();

open?.({
  message: ""A plain notification"",
  // @ts-expect-error type
  type: """"
})
```

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

Allow *no* or *plain* type as well as *info* and *warning* for notification options.

This can probably be done by extending the type of the `type` property to accept additional types, including no type.
It would be preferable if the `type` property also could be omitted to default to a plain notification.

```diff
interface OpenNotificationParams {
  key?: string;
  message: string;
+ type?: """" | ""success"" | ""info"" | ""warning"" | ""error"" | ""progress"";
- type: ""success"" | ""error"" | ""progress"";

I am working on a multitenancy app, and my authentication logic requires calling the Auth.check function with some custom properties like the dynamic domain name, so that I can do some required validation

The work around I have for now is to create a local clone of the Authenticated component and made it accept an optional param in its properties, then passed that to the useIsAuthenticated hook in the component.

Trying to use refine without material ui or antd or anything of the sort for personal taste reasons (and a big reason why I adopted refine).
But I found it quite difficult to actually develop a proper customized solution on the most surface level.. For example it is impossible to sufficiently customize the `AuthPage` without swizzling, but doing the same for the `Link` of the `routerProvider` is plain impossible in conventional methods 🤷🏻‍♂️

2510011808,6306,[BUG] @refinedev/react-hook-form useForm not detecting changes correctly,"### Describe the bug

I have been debugging the functionality for `warnWhenUnsavedChanges` and I found that `react-hook-form` only ever emits a type with subscription event objects on blur?

At https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/react-hook-form/src/useForm/index.ts#L223-L230 your checking the type, which causes value changes to never trigger the `onValuesChange` callback and so the unsaved changed warn never works.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a shadcn based form with `react-hook-form` and `warnWhenUnsavedChanges` enabled. This should be inside a dialog.
2. Add a breakpoint on that code.
3. Find that it never triggers b/c the state never includes a `type` when `value` is passed.

### Expected behavior

`warnWhenUnsavedChanges` should function correctly with state change detection enabling it.

2498730919,6289,[BUG]Unable to populate data using useList with GraphQL in Refine - data remains undefined,"### Describe the bug

0

I'm working on a React application using the Refine framework along with GraphQL. I'm trying to insert mock data into a component using the useList hook. The mock data should be fetched from a GraphQL resource (dealStages) that I learned about in a recent YouTube tutorial.

However, I'm encountering an issue where the data variable remains undefined, and I'm unable to retrieve any data. Below is the relevant part of my code:

import { DASHBOARD_DEALS_CHART_QUERY } from '@/graphql/queries';
import { mapDealsData } from '@/utilities/helpers';
import { Area, AreaConfig } from '@ant-design/plots';
import { useList, HttpError } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import React from 'react';

const DealsChart = () => {
  // Use the useList from refine that enables fetching data from our API:
  const { data } = useList({
    resource: 'dealStages',
    meta: {
      gqlQuery: DASHBOARD_DEALS_CHART_QUERY,
    },
  });

  console.log(data);

  const config: AreaConfig = {
    data: [],
  };

  const dealData = React.useMemo(() => {
    return mapDealsData(data?.data);
  }, [data?.data]);

  // Rest of the component...
};

And here's the DASHBOARD_DEALS_CHART_QUERY:

export const DASHBOARD_DEALS_CHART_QUERY = gql`
  query DashboardDealsChart(
    $filter: DealStageFilter!
    $sorting: [DealStageSort!]
    $paging: OffsetPaging
  ) {
    dealStages(filter: $filter, sorting: $sorting, paging: $paging) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        dealsAggregate {
          groupBy {
            closeDateMonth
            closeDateYear
          }
          sum {
            value
          }
        }
      }
      totalCount
    }
  }
`;

Issue:

The data variable remains undefined when I log it, which means that my component doesn't receive any data to work with. Questions:

Is there something I'm missing in the way I'm using useList with GraphQL in Refine? Could there be an issue with the GraphQL query, or should I be passing additional parameters to the useList hook? What could be the reason for the data not being fetched properly, and how can I resolve it? If there's any other information that might be helpful, please let me know. Thanks in advance for your assistance!



### Steps To Reproduce

run the app
wait  untill you go back to login page due to auth error. 
Query data cannot be undefined. Please make sure to return a value other than undefined from your query function. Affected query key: [""auth"",""identity""]

### Expected behavior

show list of element from graphql mock data.

I want to be able to add translations in the dictionary and make refine automatically use these for the default filterOperators' labels without needing to build my own filters from scratch. Since this is not possible, using the defaultOperators makes it that I get labels that don't translate along. I have to define my own currently anyway so that I can override the label with a translation, which defeats the purpose of having a default. Unable to find a way to do this currently. It makes a lot of sense to pull these by default from your translation provider and fallback to the labels that already exist currently.

2475753998,6273,[BUG] `eq` Filter Operation Used Instead of Custom filterOperator in Supabase Data Provider,"### Describe the bug

I have built an application using Refine and the Supabase data provider. When I attempt to perform a search operation, the filter operation is always set to eq (equals) in the request sent to the data provider and the router, despite specifying a different filterOperator in the column's meta property.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Column Definition:

Below is the column definition I am using:

`{
    accessorKey: ""name"",
    header: ({ column }) => {
      return <DataTableColumnHeader column={column} title=""Name"" />;
    },
    cell: ({ row }) => {
      return (
        <div className=""flex space-x-2"">
          <span className=""max-w-[500px] truncate font-medium"">
            {row.getValue(""name"")}
          </span>
        </div>
      );
    },
    meta: {
        filterOperator: ""contains"", // Intended to use ""contains"" operation
    }
}`

2. Input Field:
Here's how I'm setting the filter value via an input field:

`<Input
    placeholder=""Filter students...""
    value={(table.getColumn(""name"")?.getFilterValue() as string) ?? """"}
    onChange={(event) =>
      table.getColumn(""name"")?.setFilterValue(event.target.value)
    }
    className=""h-8 w-[150px] lg:w-[250px]""
/>`

### Expected behavior

The search operation should use the contains filter operator as specified in the column's meta property.

Actual Behavior:
The filter operation is always sent as eq (equals) to the Supabase data provider and the router, ignoring the specified filterOperator.

### Packages

""@refinedev/core"": ""^4.54.0"",

### Additional Context

2473435401,6270,[BUG] Success and Error notifications cannot return `undefined` to fallback to default,"### Update 

This issue was initially opened up as a feature request and converted to a bug. The requested feature is possible with the current implementation but the types are not supporting returning `undefined` from `successNotification` and `errorNotification` props of the hooks when passed as functions. 

Check out the comment https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/6270#issuecomment-2302021525 about the issue and the fix. 

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

If there are field validation errors from the server side, I want to hide the snackbar (by using a custom errorNotification and then simply not displaying it), but otherwise, display the default error notification snackbar. To do that, I currently need to recreate the default error manually (unless I'm mistaken). 

```
useForm<Translation, HttpError>({
    refineCoreProps: {
      errorNotification: error => {
        if (error?.response?.data?.fieldError) return false

        return {
          message: `There was an error creating your resource (status code: ${error?.statusCode})`,
          description: error?.message,
          type: 'error',
        }
      },
    },
  })
  ```

### Describe alternatives you've considered

There should be a way to 'passthrough' and use the default notification if my condition to use a custom errorNotification is not met

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

Instead of the code above, it should be possible to return the original error notification, like so:

```
useForm<Translation, HttpError>({
    refineCoreProps: {
      errorNotification: (error, originalErrorNotification) => {
        if (error?.response?.data?.fieldError) return false

        return originalErrorNotification
      },
    },
  })
  ```",,
2473375942,6269,[BUG] Default notificationProvider has duplicate keys issue,"### Describe the bug

When two notifications of the same kind appear in close progression, the notifications can have same keys, causing both to disappear at once, even though the latest snackbar only just appeared.

### Steps To Reproduce

When you edit a form entry (using useForm and the default notificationProvider), then quickly edit the same form again, then you will get two notification snackbars with the same key, causing unexpected behavior.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5b858f-263d-4b36-b4bf-fcab0349b04a)

### Expected behavior

What should happen instead is that both snackbars should have unique keys, so that they do not disappear together when they are closed.

Wondering if it has any effect on the infinite rendering of `useTable`. Because there was a TanStack's [issue](https://github.com/TanStack/table/issues/4240) that is quite similar to it.

2470666738,6264,[BUG] Resource routes using path param other than id not being substituted in URL,"### Describe the bug

We would like to route based on a unique slug using react router and the refine resource definitions rather than the ids to have more readable URLs. When we try and use a resource path such as `show: ""/publishers/show/:handle""` it doesn't substitute the handle field but rather puts `:handle` directly in the URL.

Do Refine resources only accept the `:id` path param?

    </Show>
  );
};
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Use Refine CLI to bootstrap project with Vite, React Router, Supabase, and AntDesign
2. Copy example App.tsx and publisher pages from bug description
3. Replace projectId with your projectId
4. Configure supabase client (an unlinked local project will work)
5. Add `publisher` table with columns: `id`, `publisher_name`, `handle` into supabase
6. Add row with `publisher_name: ""Test Publisher""` and `handle: ""test-publisher""`
7. Start refine app and open in browser
8. Find `Test Publisher` in table and click the view icon
9. Note the url includes the raw string `:handle`

### Expected behavior

Refine correctly substitutes the `:handle` param with the `handle` field from the entity in the URL.

While `@refinedev/antd`'s `<ThemedLayoutV2 />` has RTL support for the sider and it works well but in mobile sider the placement is not respecting the changes in `direction`. Styling of the drawer trigger is also not updated with direction changes.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set up a Refine + Ant Design app
2. Wrap the app with `<ConfigProvider />` and pass `direction=""rtl""`
3. On small screen sizes, observe the drawer and the trigger is not placed properly (check above screenshot)

2467635559,6259,[BUG] `queryOptions.enabled` causes `undefined` request to be sent in `useForm`,"### Describe the bug

When working with a form in `""edit'` mode if the `id` is obtained in async manner, we're disabling the query with  `queryOptions.enabled: !!id` to avoid console.warning about missing ID. This causes a broken request to be sent with `id: undefined` to the data provider when `id` is obtained.

**Flow**
- `useForm` doesn't send a request when `id` is not defined
- `id` is obtained and passed to the `useForm`
- `useForm` sends one request with `id: undefined` and immediately sends a new one with correct `id`.

### Steps To Reproduce

```tsx
import React from ""react"";
import { useForm } from ""@refinedev/core"";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [id, setId] = React.useState(undefined);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Set `id` after 1 second of delay for demo purposes.
    setTimeout(() => {
      setId(""123"");
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  const form = useForm({
    resource: ""posts"",
    id: id,
    queryOptions: {
      // Disable query if id is not defined
      enabled: typeof id !== ""undefined"",
    },
  });
  
  return ( ... );
}
```

After the page is rendered,

- No requests will be sent before `id` is set
- When `id` is set, a request will be sent with `id: undefined`
- Immediately after the first request, a request will be made with `id: ""123""`

### Expected behavior

Changes in the `id` prop is set in an effect, this causes one render delay before `id` is set properly, yet when we pass `queryOptions.enabled` by looking at the `id` prop, query will be enabled right when `id` is set. This causes a broken request to be made to the API. 

The correct behavior should be setting the `id` immediately without a delay, then no extra requests will be made.

Hello, I have encountered a bug with Keycloak.

I have created a new app with `npm create refine-app@latest`, using Keycloak as auth provider.
The app builds fine, but upon trying to log in, I get redirected back to login page with url params. I will provide screenshots of the process.

1. Refine login page

Just to note, this behavior is not observed when creating an example with `npm create refine-app@latest -- --example auth-keycloak`

Another side note, the login credentials in the documentation are not updated, username and password should be refine and not Refine.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a new app with `npm create refine-app@latest`, select Keycloak as auth provider, other options are not relevant
2. Cd to project, run `npm run dev`
3. Click 'Sign in' button
4. Enter login credentials

### Expected behavior

Expected behavior is that with the provided credentials, a user should be logged in, instead, the user is redirected back to the login page with additional URL parameters.

2442280414,6219,[BUG] Element Selector in Devtools causing crash through `e.getBoundingClientRect is not a function`,"### Describe the bug

When clicking the Element Selector in the small devtools panel, the page breaks (most likely something undefined is trying to be used) and reports the following:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4bc795d-f807-4dd5-99a1-85626c6b9bb8)


### Steps To Reproduce

1. Install devtools according to the [documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/development/#installation-1) (the manual one).
2. Insert devtools into the app as per the [usage](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/development/#usage-1).
3. Run the application.
4. Click the Element Selector button in the devtools panel.

### Expected behavior

The Element Selector should open and allow me to select items on the website etc.

2439559512,6216,[BUG] `<DateField value={undefined} />` is still displaying the date,"### Describe the bug

Under the hood, `<DateField />` components of Refine's UI implementations use `dayjs`. As an expected behavior of `dayjs`, when you construct a `Dayjs` object with an empty/undefined value it will use the current date time. This causes `<DateField value={undefined} />` to display current date instead of rendering nothing.

```tsx
import { useShow } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { DateField } from ""@refinedev/antd"";
import { Typography } from ""antd"";

export const PostDetails = () => {
  const { query } = useShow();

  return (
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Title</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Text>{data.data?.title}</Typography.Text>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Created At</Typography.Title>
    {/* Assume `createdAt` is not present in the response */}
    <DateField value={data.data?.createdAt} />
  );
}
```

This will render the current date.

```ts
import dayjs from ""dayjs"";

console.log(dayjs().format(""DD-MM-YYYY"")); // 31-07-2024

console.log(dayjs(Date.now()).format(""DD-MM-YYYY"")); // 31-07-2024
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Import `DateField` from any UI implementation of Refine.
2. Pass `undefined` or a reference to a non-existing property in an object to the `value` prop.
3. Check to see `<DateField value={undefined} />` rendering the current date.

### Expected behavior

`<DateField value={undefined} />` should return `null` and display nothing. 

Implementations should be updated to check for `undefined` values and return `null` in that case.

Type-safety between API and refinedev application must be meticulously managed.

Complex and opinionated options do exist (e.g. GraphQL), and any solution will have some amount of overhead, but the overhead just seems like too much for small teams. I believe refinedev has and will continue to focus on the DX while quickly building functional and user-friendly applications. The DX when it comes to managing a contract for queries and mutations between the refinedev application and the API has been one of the most challenging parts of building my current application. I spend an estimated 20% of my time just in reconciling inconsistencies between what the API offers and what the refinedev application should offer to end users.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

GraphQL - While there are differing opinions amount how it compares with other options, there are tools to generate types for the quereies and mutations. The draw backs here lies in the complexity of developing a GraphQL API, which varies from developer to developer.  

tRPC - Closest to what I am hoping to get. It is another viable option

I know REST, and it provides what I need, and I don't intend on moving away from it until the DX for another option becomes simpler with the same capabilities.

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

Disclaimer: I have not used ts-rest yet. While ts-rest claims to be production ready, it has only been around for about 2 years from my research.

[ts-rest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-rest/core) offers type safety without the need for code generation. 

I am looking at developing my own data provider for ts-rest. 

Here is my biggest reason. The ""contract"" is defined where the data is coming from, i.e. the API.
The contract is written in typescript, which allows for the use of zod schemas to define the contract.

As long as a standard structure for a ts-rest API can be defined such that the endpoints can be accessed by resource and the specific query or mutation (e.g. list, one, create, etc.), the DX looks promising.

What are the thoughts from other refinedev community members on this subject? I am not aware if this has or has not been brought up yet.

2425633266,6181,[BUG] `onFinish` from `useModalForm` doesn't have same behavior as `onFinish` from `formProps`,"### Describe the bug

I ran into something I believe is a doc issue (or possibly a bug) with `useModalForm` from `@refinedev/antd`.

I implemented a form where I need to do a file upload upon submitting the form, so I provided my own method to `onFinish` in the `Form` component. Based on the [doc](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-modal-form/#close), I thought I could call `onFinish` and then `close`. But I ran into the following behaviors:

1. The user sees the dialog about unsaved changes (which seems like an issue on its own).
2. If they click Cancel, they get correctly returned to the dialog.
3. If they click OK (i.e., OK to discard changes), it ends up updating the resource anyway, which I can confirm from PUT/PATCH calls being made by the browser.

I realized after much trial and error that the right method to call is not `onFinish` from `useModalForm`, but `onFinish` from the `formProps`. Furthermore, I don't need to call close  since `onFinish`  seems to close the dialog already. So a couple questions:

1. Is the sample in the [doc](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-modal-form/#close) correct?
```
import { useModalForm } from ""@refinedev/antd"";
import { Form, Input, Modal } from ""antd"";


const { close, modalProps, formProps, onFinish } = useModalForm();

const onFinishHandler = (values) => {
  // do some work
  onFinish(values);
  close();
};

      <Form.Item label=""Title"" name=""title"">
        <Input />
      </Form.Item>
    </Form>
  </Modal>
);
```

This repros the 3 behaviors I mentioned above. It seems like even if `onFinish` from `useModalForm` is the right method to call, the close call would be unnecessary.

2. Why is `onFinish` from `useModalForm` not the same as the one from `formProps`? Based on the [doc](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-modal-form/#close), it says the only difference is passing a value is mandatory, but in my experience they handle submission and closing differently.

### Steps To Reproduce

Use the sample for `close()` from the [doc](https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/hooks/use-modal-form/#close).

### Expected behavior

Form closes without warning about unsaved changes, and the documentation correctly includes (or excludes) the use of `close()` with `onFinish()`.

  useActiveAuthProvider,
  useLink,

1. Create a Nextjs + Headless UI project from site.
2. Run `npm run refine swizzle`

I'm following the example for Material UI on this page: https://refine.dev/docs/packages/react-hook-form/introduction/#usage

My imports are:

```
import { useForm } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";
import { Controller } from ""react-hook-form"";
```

The problem is that it looks we have to use the Edit component from Material UI in order to use Controller, otherwise I get the error:

`React Router caught the following error during render TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'subscribe')`

When I wrap my form within the Edit component, this error goes away, but I don't want to use Edit from material UI for my form. Is there a way around this? I'm currently having to use register instead, but I need to use some Material components like Autocomplete.

2406731719,6137,[FEAT] Improving Type Parameter Specification in useForm Hook,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I'm developing a user information editing page using Refine, and I'm facing difficulties in clearly distinguishing between the form structure and the data type submitted to the DataProvider.

If you know of some way, please let me know.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

If I don't specify types in the useForm function, this issue doesn't occur. However, that would negate the purpose of using TypeScript.

### Additional context

## Current Status and Investigation
I've extensively reviewed documentation and advanced tutorials on how to specify useForm's type parameters effectively, but haven't found a solution yet.

## Context
Here is the project setup and code where I encountered the issue.

### Framework Structure
Routing: Next.js (App Router)
Data Provider: SimpleRest
UI: Material UI

### The Flow of Data
![DataFlow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b743696-5f7a-43d7-b1b8-9f200ac4cdfe)

### Problematic Code
I think it's beneficial that the FormProps type specified as the third type parameter of useForm is used by the reset and handleSubmit functions. This is because they rely on the form structure.

However, the same type is also enforced for the argument of the onFinish function. This causes a type error when trying to convert the FormProps type to the User type inside the handleSubmitInner function during submission.

```ts
""use client"";

import { HttpError } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { Edit } from ""@refinedev/mui"";
import { useForm } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";
import { useEffect } from ""react"";

interface User {
  email: string;
  user_metadata: {
    display_name: string;
  };
}

interface FormProps {
  email: string;
  userName: string;
}

export default function UserEdit() {
  const {
    refineCore: { queryResult, onFinish },
    reset,
    handleSubmit,
  } = useForm<User, HttpError, FormProps>();

  const user = queryResult?.data?.data;

  // Called when the page is loaded
  useEffect(() => {
    // Map the user information received from the API to the form
    // Calling reset sets the values entered in the form all at once
    reset({
      email: user?.email,
      userName: user?.user_metadata?.display_name,
    });
  }, [reset, user]);

  // Called when submitting the form
  const handleSubmitInner = (formProps: FormProps) => {
    // Map the information entered in the form to the API
    onFinish({
      email: formProps.email,
      // A type error is output at this line.
      // This is because the argument type of the onFinish function becomes FormProps,
      // which is specified as the third type parameter of useForm.
      user_metadata: {
        display_name: formProps.userName,
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <Edit
      saveButtonProps={{
        onClick: handleSubmit(handleSubmitInner),
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Edit>
  );
}

```

### Describe the thing to improve

To resolve this issue, consider adding an additional type parameter like SubmissionData to useForm. This would clarify distinctions between form structure and submission data types, ensuring a smoother TypeScript-driven development process.

```ts
""use client"";

import { HttpError } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { Edit } from ""@refinedev/mui"";
import { useForm } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";

export default function UserEdit() {
  const {
    refineCore: { queryResult, onFinish },
    reset,
    handleSubmit,
    // The 4th type parameter is the type of the submission.
    // It will be a argument of onFinish, so it should be User.
  } = useForm<User, HttpError, FormProps, User>();

  width=""100""
  height=""100""
  alt=""resource output of handler function""
/>

### Expected Behaviour

Similar to the `useMenu` hook, I expect `resource.meta.label` to have a default value. This value should be singular or plural depending on the action, uppercase, and i18n supported.

Also, it shouldn't override if `resource.meta.label` given

### Describe the thing to improve

When `resource.meta.label` has a default value, I can use it like this:

```tsx
<DocumentTitleHandler
  handler={({ action, params, resource }) => {
    const id = params?.id ?? """";

    const actionPrefixMatcher = {
      create: ""Create new "",
      clone: `#${id} Clone ${resource?.meta?.label}`,
      edit: `#${id} Edit ${resource?.meta?.label}`,
      show: `#${id} Show ${resource?.meta?.label}`,
      list: `${resource?.meta?.label}`,
    };

    const suffix = "" | <Company Name>"";
    const title = actionPrefixMatcher[action || ""list""] + suffix;

    return title;
  }}
/>
```

2400676055,6119,"[FEAT] `@refinedev/supabase` missing support for date ranges and ""between"" filter operator","### Describe the bug

I'm using the example below with antd and supabase.

https://refine.dev/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/components/filter-dropdown/#rangepickerfiltermapper

When trying to filter no results are returned by supabase query which looks something like this:

Query string parameters:
select: *
offset: 0
limit: 10
order: created_at.desc
created_at: in.(2024-06-30T21:00:00.000Z,2024-07-03T21:00:00.000Z)

The problem is that is should look something like this:

Query string parameters::
select: *
offset: 0
limit: 10
order: created_at.desc
created_at: gte.2024-06-30T21:00:00.000Z
created_at: lte.2024-07-03T21:00:00.000Z

Another thing that doesn't work is the ""defaultFiltertedValue"" even if i change the operator from ""between"" to ""in"".

it would be nice if we had an example of a working date filter in CodeSandbox on this page or update the existing one to include a Date column.


### Steps To Reproduce

Use the example in the link above

### Expected behavior

It should filter using ""gte"" and ""lte"" operators not ""in"" operator.

I believe there's an unexpected side effect when using a data provider and passing the URL param. It's possible to replicate the issue in the `app-crm` template. 

If you change the `auth.ts` file's URL's, then any subsequent call to the data provider will use the value passed into the `url` param:

```

_No response_",2217479557,"I was investigating the issue and I'd need more context on what you're looking to do here. 

One of the things that came up is that, even though you allow for HTTP methods to be specified by the `custom` function, the method is not actually being used to make the request; it always uses `POST`. `graphql-request` itself also only allows for `GET` or `POST`, so all of the other methods allowed by the `CustomParams` interface are pointless and would need to be narrowed down into the allowed methods anyways.

So what is the purpose of the `custom` function? Should clients be allowed to make actual `GET` requests to their GraphQL clients? What about the other HTTP methods? If they are to be allowed, it won't be through `graphql-request`.

PS.: One more note. The `request` function from `graphql-request`, as in `import { request } from graphql-request`, does not allow the HTTP method to be specified, so we'd need a new instance of the GraphQLClient. If only `POST` is to be allowed, then it's possible to get by without a new instance and just using the `request` function."

2391033365,6102,[FEAT]: `useUpdate()` should accept `MutateFunction` params,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Here is the usage of the `useUpdate` hook:

```tsx
import { useUpdate } from ""@refinedev/core"";

const { mutate } = useUpdate();

mutate(
  {
    resource: ""products"",
    id: 1,
    mutationMode: ""optimistic"",
    successNotification: false,
    values: {
      name: ""New Product"",
      material: ""Wood"",
    },
  },
  {
    onSuccess: () => {
      /* do something after mutation success */
    },
  },
);
```

In this use case, all parameters except the `values` are static. However, when I want to use the `mutate` function in different places, I have to rewrite these values, which can cause code duplication.

### Describe the thing to improve

To improve developer experience, the `useUpdate()` hook can directly pass all required values to the `mutate` function. This will reduce code duplication and improve readability.

New API:

```tsx
import { useUpdate } from ""@refinedev/core"";

const Demo = () => {
  const { mutate } = useUpdate({
    resource: ""products"",
    id: 1,

    mutationOptions: {
      onSuccess: () => {
        /* do something after mutation success */
      },
    },
  });

  const handleUpdate = (values) => {
    mutate({
      values,
    });
  };

Confirming the issue about the debounced callback of `onSearch`. Thank you for the detailed explanation. I've tested out a fix in the `useSelect`, let me explain it below and maybe you can create a PR for it 🚀

This prop also causes re-renders if it's inlined. We can store it in a ref like this:

```ts
  /**
   * To avoid any changes in the `onSearch` callback,
   * We're storing `onSearchFromProp` in a ref and accessing it in the `onSearch` callback.
   */
  const onSearchFromPropRef = useRef(onSearchFromProp);

  useEffect(() => {
    onSearchFromPropRef.current = onSearchFromProp;
  }, [onSearchFromProp]);
```

We should move `debounce` into the `onSearch` and memoize it:

Current:
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/49d65bf7a35c96a9d0f5ffafdd40c7d0526eaf2e/packages/core/src/hooks/useSelect/index.ts#L338-L356

Wrapping it with `useMemo` and using `debounce` in the definition:

```ts
  const onSearch = useMemo(() => {
    return debounce((value: string) => {
      if (onSearchFromPropRef.current) {
        setSearch(onSearchFromPropRef.current(value));
        return;
      }

      if (!value) {
        setSearch([]);
        return;

          value,
        },
      ]);
    }, debounceValue);
  }, [searchField, debounceValue]);
  ```
  
  Then we can just update the return statement:
  
  ```diff
return {
    queryResult,
    defaultValueQueryResult,
    options: combinedOptions,
-   onSearch: debounce(onSearch, debounceValue),
+   onSearch,
    overtime: { elapsedTime },
  };

2. Each generated page.tsx file should export the page component with `export default function`.",2205911005,"Refine is independent of the route package and can be used with Remix, React Router, Next.js App Router, or Next.js Pages Router. While there may not be an issue currently, we believe that separating the JSX code of resources into components is the correct approach.

For example, when using React Router, we write:
```tsx

```
However, with Next.js, we use a file-based system to achieve the same result. Fundamentally, we believe that the rendered output in this route should be a separate component.

Additionally, the Next.js App Router defaults to server components, but components generated by the Refine CLI cannot run on the server. Therefore, we need to add the ""use-client"" directive at the top of the file we create. If we create the resource component in `/src/app/{resource name}`,  unfortunately, we take away the user's ability to use this route on the server."

Below is my request
1. When using Refine with Next.js, adding resources via CLI should generate appropriate page.tsx files under /src/app/.
2. Each generated page.tsx file should export the page component with `export default function`.",2206056717,"
Thank you for the detailed explanation.

I now understand why the `npx refine add resource` command creates a component file instead of a page, and I agree that maintaining this feature makes sense.

Now, regarding your idea of adding an option to the npx refine add resource command—specifically `--for-next-app`:

With this option, when executing npx refine add resource, instead of creating a component file, a page.tsx file would be generated under `/src/app/{resource name}` following the routing structure. The contents of the file would be almost identical to the current setup, but would use `export default function` instead of `export const`.

Additionally, it might be beneficial to add a `--for-next-page` option for those using the Next.js page router.

Having these options would allow developers using Next.js with Refine to effortlessly generate CRUD pages for their resources without any further modifications, simply by running a command."

2. Each generated page.tsx file should export the page component with `export default function`.",2206198535,"The current components need the ""use client"" directive to be compatible with RSC, but adding this to all files would restrict users. We agree to update the command to include `page.tsx` files that correctly import and return these components, but filling `page.tsx` with them could limit users.

For example, if we keep resource components in the components folder, we can:

- Use Next.js to fetch data from a database and pass it as a prop to the resource component.
- Perform operations with `loader()` using tanstack-router, Remix, or react-router-dom.

Generating the resource component directly in `page.tsx` with the ""use client"" directive would be like doing this:

```jsx
<Route
  path=""posts/list""
  Component={() => {
    return <div>{/** Generated resource component code */}</div>;
  }}
/>
```

Also, we don't need to add an option to Refine CLI. We can detect the type of application (Next.js, Vite, Remix, etc.) and make the necessary adjustments. The Refine CLI can already do this, but we need extra control for Next.js appdir and pages."

Directory import `node_modules/@mui/material/Box` is not supported resolving ES modules imported from `node_modules/@refinedev/mui/dist/index.mjs`.
```

After extensive research, I found out that Node.JS doesn't support Directory imports. At least not yet. This is an issue with the latest release of the `@refinedev/mui` library. It imports Material UI components via directories.

This error was noticed when running tests using vitest in my application.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Setup a basic React application with Vite and install latest release of necessary dependencies for refine:

3. Create a basic test file. `App.test.tsx`
4. Run vitest and see the error in the terminal.


### Expected behavior

I expected the tests to run properly. If there were no Directory imports in the `node_modules/@refinedev/mui/dist/index.mjs` file, there wouldn't have been an issue. A minor fix to move from directory imports to file imports will be good and following the standards set by Node.JS

We can update all our usage in `@refinedev/mui` from subpath imports to index imports for `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material` and `@mui/lab` which will fix the issue for vitest but previously we had issues with these imports for the bundle size especially in Next.js. We'll investigate if the current state of the bundlers work well to modularize those imports in our package.

Currently, due to issues in Material UI some bundler fail to interpret Material UI imports as ESM. This is not actionable on our side until there are any progress on Material UI side. 🙏 

As a workaround for vitest, inlining the `@refinedev/mui` dep. resolves the errors. Check out below code:

```diff
// vite.config.ts
/// <reference types=""vitest"" />
import { defineConfig } from ""vite"";
import react from ""@vitejs/plugin-react"";

export default defineConfig({

2378795133,6086,[BUG] - Serialized Error: { code: 'ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT' },"### Describe the bug

```
Directory import `node_modules/@mui/material/Box` is not supported resolving ES modules imported from `node_modules/@refinedev/mui/dist/index.mjs`.
```

After extensive research, I found out that Node.JS doesn't support Directory imports. At least not yet. This is an issue with the latest release of the `@refinedev/mui` library. It imports Material UI components via directories.

This error was noticed when running tests using vitest in my application.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Setup a basic React application with Vite and install latest release of necessary dependencies for refine:
```
""@refinedev/core"": ""^4.51.0"",
""@refinedev/mui"": ""^5.17.0"",
```
2. Setup standard configurations for vitest after installing `vitest` , `@testing-library/dom`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, and `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
3. Create a basic test file. `App.test.tsx`
4. Run vitest and see the error in the terminal.


### Expected behavior

I expected the tests to run properly. If there were no Directory imports in the `node_modules/@refinedev/mui/dist/index.mjs` file, there wouldn't have been an issue. A minor fix to move from directory imports to file imports will be good and following the standards set by Node.JS

2378079455,6085,[BUG] graphql-default naming convention in Hasura does not seem to be supported in Refine,"### Describe the bug

I am having difficulties correctly fetching data from my database using Hasura as the data provider. I am trying to utilize the useList hook to retrieve data, using the following code snippet:

```
export const DashboardTasksChart: React.FC = () => {
   const { list } = useNavigation();
   const { data, isError, error } = useList<
      GetFieldsFromList<DashboardTasksChartQuery>
    >({
      resource: ""task_stages"",
      pagination: {
        pageSize: 4,
      },
      sorters: [
        {
          field: ""title"",
          order: ""asc"",
        },
      ],
      filters: [
        {
          field: ""id"",
          operator: ""eq"",
          value: 1,
        },
      ],
      meta: { 
        gqlQuery: DASHBOARD_TASKS_CHART_QUERY
      },
    });

    if (isError) {
      console.error(""Error fetching task chart data"", error);
      return null;
      }

...
```

While using sorters, I get the following error in the console:

`Error: expected one of the values ['ASC', 'ASC_NULLS_FIRST', 'ASC_NULLS_LAST', 'DESC', 'DESC_NULLS_FIRST', 'DESC_NULLS_LAST'] for type 'OrderBy', but found 'asc':`

If I make 'asc' uppercase, I get the following warning in my IDE:
```
Type '""DESC""' is not assignable to type '""asc"" | ""desc""'. Did you mean '""desc""'?
```
It seems crudSort is hard-coded to only accept lowercase sorters, which Hasura does not accept (using the graphql-default naming convention, released 2022).

If I remove the sorters, and only use the filtering, I get the following error in the console:
```
Error: variable 'where' is declared as 'taskStages_bool_exp', but used where 'TaskStagesBoolExp' is expected: {""response"":{""errors"":[{""message"":""variable 'where' is declared as 'taskStages_bool_exp', but used where 'TaskStagesBoolExp' is expected"",""extensions"":{""path"":""$.selectionSet.taskStages.args.where"",""code"":""validation-failed""}}],""status"":200,""headers"":{""map"":{""content-type"":""application/json; charset=utf-8""}}},""request"":{""query"":""query ($limit: Int, $offset: Int, $where: taskStages_bool_exp) { taskStages (limit: $limit, offset: $offset, where: $where)  taskStages_aggregate (where: $where) { aggregate { count } } }"",""variables"":{""limit"":4,""offset"":0,""where"":{""_and"":[{""id"":{""_eq"":1}}]}}}}
```

Hasura default uses taskStages_bool_exp, but with the graphql-default naming convention, it expects types as PascalCase, such as: `TaskStagesBoolExp`, which is defined in my query:

```
export const DASHBOARD_TASKS_CHART_QUERY = gql`
    query DashboardTasksChart(
        $where: TaskStagesBoolExp
        $order_by: [TaskStagesOrderBy!]
        $limit: Int!
        $offset: Int!
    ) {
        taskStages(where: $where, orderBy: $order_by, limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
            title
            tasksAggregate {
                aggregate {
                    totalCount: count
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
``` 

Is there any quick-fix to making the naming-convention I have started with, correctly working?
Thanks in advance.

2372251741,6077,[BUG] MUI Data Grid no longer horizontally scaling (also on official examples),"### Describe the bug

When the browser window size is reduced, then horizontal scaling does not properly occur (table keeps full width and flows under the sidebar). A hard page refresh correctly resizes the table. Increasing window size scales the Data Grid properly, decreasing window size does not. This bug started occurring last Friday, possibly connected to a Chrome update.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Use latest version of Google Chrome
2. Open up any of Refine's official examples using MUI and its Data Grid
3. Reduce the browser window size by making Chrome dev tools larger
4. Instead of scaling, the columns of the Data Grid do not reduce in size and full table width is maintained

2366098165,6067,[BUG] `<AutoSaveIndicator />` throws warning for `key` prop,"### Describe the bug

When using the auto save feature, `<AutoSaveIndicator />` component from UI packages are logging errors about the usage of reserved `key` prop in the console. This is caused by the component itself rather than the code in the user space. 

This error also causes issues when using `i18nProvider` to localize the message.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Enable `autoSave` prop in `useForm`
2. Use `<AutoSaveIndicator />` or pass `autoSaveProps` to CRUD components.
3. Check console to see the error

type UseSelectProps<...> = {
  /* ... */
  selectedOptionsOrder?: SelectedOptionsOrder; // This will be default to ""in-place"" which is. the current behavior.

Default value should be `""in-place""` in order to keep the current behavior as default. 

There are also extensions of the `useSelect` hook such as `useSelect` from `@refinedev/antd` which may require small changes but I guess those won't take much time or might not require any change at all.

I took a brief glance at source code and it looks like such behavior is mostly related to routing. All other cases (clicking on <Link /> elements, home or refresh buttons) are covered. It also works as expected when you navigate directly to edit page (e.g. pasting a link to it), not from list view. That's because in the latter case ```beforeunload``` is triggered not just for home and refresh buttons, but for back/forward as well.",2181003039,"Hey @tlkv thank you for the detailed explanation! I think this can be handled by adding an event listener for `popstate` and also by using a *hacky* way to manipulate `window.history`. Doing this will break the forward states and disable the forward button if unsaved changes notifier is triggered due to the nature of `window.history` API 😅 

Something like this:

```tsx
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (warnWhen) {
      // push the current state (this will break the forward actions)
      window.history.pushState(null, document.title, location.href);

      const popstateListener = (event: PopStateEvent) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        // prompt user for the navigation
        if (window.confirm(warnMessage)) {
          setWarnWhen?.(false);
          // go back if confirmed
          window.history.back();
        } else {
          // restore duplicate state
          window.history.pushState(null, document.title, location.href);
        }
      };

      addEventListener(""popstate"", popstateListener);

      return () => {
        removeEventListener(""popstate"", popstateListener);
      };
    }

    return () => 0;
  }, [pathname, warnMessage, warnWhen]);
```

While this may work, we probably need to remove the override of `navigator.go` from the `usePrompt` hook to make sure they're not conflicting with each other. 

I'm not sure if this is worth breaking the forward buttons 🤔 Maybe there can be a prop in `<UnsavedChangesNotifier />` to introduce this behavior. Adding this without keeping the current behavior is kinda a breaking change 🤖 

Do you have any suggestions or alternative ideas for the implementation? "

I've tried it as global one (by adding to ```UnsavedChangesNotifier```) and also on component level. While I haven't encountered any conflicts with ```navigator.go``` from ```usePrompt```, there seems to be a problem with **back button on the page**, not browser one. If you edit any field and then click on this button you get redirected to the same url since ```pushState``` made a temporary duplicate. So we fix one thing and break another 😅 Header props can be overridden e.g. ```headerProps={{ onBack: () => ... }}```, but TBH it seems as too much hassle for such a feature.

I think this solution might be satisfactory to use only for certain components, but not as a global one. So I wouldn't introduce this behavior as breaking change, unless it depends on some prop, just as you mentioned.

Another suggestion would be to postpone this issue (maybe convert to discussion for now) until the new data router from React Router V6 is fully supported and then just rely on their features like https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-prompt instead of current ```usePrompt``` workaround."

I took a brief glance at source code and it looks like such behavior is mostly related to routing. All other cases (clicking on <Link /> elements, home or refresh buttons) are covered. It also works as expected when you navigate directly to edit page (e.g. pasting a link to it), not from list view. That's because in the latter case ```beforeunload``` is triggered not just for home and refresh buttons, but for back/forward as well.",2242725303,"Hey @tlkv, thank you for your comment! Discussed further with the Refine team and we've decided to postpone until we've settled with the new features of React Router, then we'll be able to fix this behavior without using some hacky workarounds. 

While acknowledging the issue, closing this for now. We'll re-open and update the issue when we have it cleared in our roadmap."

My advice is to adopt a naming convention for each of your packages. Add a prefix or suffix to distinguish between two similar, but separate entities. Example [ButtonBase](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/22c5206a9e8191b2f81131d6978a0958e55b7032/packages/mui-material/src/ButtonBase/ButtonBase.js) and [Button](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/next/packages/mui-material/src/Button/Button.js).

When you have decided on a convention it can be enforced with https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/naming-convention/#prefix--suffix where each one of your packages will have the rule configured differently.

The end result would be that you can safely import:
```ts
// before
import { UseFormProps } from ""@refinedev/core"";
import { UseFormProps } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";

// after
import { UseFormPropsCore } from ""refinedev/core"";
import { UseFormPropsHookForm } from ""@refinedev/react-hook-form"";
```

I hope you'll be able to come up with a more elegant solution, but this is the best option I can think of atm."

2344335752,6030,[BUG] fix(devtools-internal): fix NODE_ENV conditional didn't work,"### Describe the bug

Hello,
@aliemir published the PR https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5992 and it works. However, esbuild doesn't compile as expected. The compiler doesn't generate correctly as you write here https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/4654353b90b6a09cbf65e41d4c1fa82553a2a3fa/packages/devtools-internal/src/use-query-subscription.tsx#L13
So, instead of
```js
() => {
        return {};
      }
```
it generates
```
() => ({})
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Install @refinedev/devtools-internal or visit the link [@refinedev/devtools-internal npm package code tab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refinedev/devtools-internal/v/1.1.11?activeTab=code)
2. Check the below expression in index.cjs and index.mjs.
```
process.env.NODE_ENV!==""development"" ? ()=>({})  : ...
```

### Expected behavior

The below expression
```js
process.env.NODE_ENV!==""development"" ? ()=>({}): ...
```

must be something similar to
```js
process.env.NODE_ENV!==""development"" ? ()=> {

I believe It's okay to add `ina_overlap` operator but I'm sorry I couldn't quite understand why `ina` doesn't work for you. It seems exactly what you looking for.

we sent this `value: [""health"", ""travel""]` with `ina`:

and we can get the following data 
- [""health"", ""travel"", ""food""]

but we can't get this because ""health"" is not available in the array.
- [""travel"", ""food""]

do you also want to get [""travel"", ""food""]?"

Ideally in my use case the query would include any post that has a tag that matches ANY in the filter vs requiring ALL to match.

Using your example, if we used `value: [""health"", ""travel""]` with `ina_overlap`, it should return the following examples:
- [""health"", ""travel""]
- [""health"", ""travel"", ""food""]
- [""health""]
- [""travel""]

Specifically in my use case, we have a table of businesses with categories tied to the industries that they're in. The categories column is an array of strings. Here's a short listing of some of the values: Aerospace, Automotive, Business Services, Consumer Products & Services, Distribution & Logistics, Education, Energy, Food and Beverage, Healthcare.

Let's say business A is in Education and Healthcare, while business B is in Automotive and Education, while business C is in Aerospace.

When filtering for `['Education', 'Healthcare']`, businesses A and B should be included because they match at least one of the values in the filter. The user might be looking for businesses in specific industries but they don't necessarily need to be a perfect match.

I hope that helps with what I'm looking for."

I thought that running the command through Git Bash would help to resolve any issue relating to `NODE_ENV` not being recognized in Windows. I then switched to using WSL with Ubuntu to install and again ran up against issues:

At that point I called it quits as I just ran out of time and thought it might be better for someone else to step in.

2341195231,6024,[FEAT] Supabase Data Provider needs an array_overlap operator,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I would like to filter an array column with an array in Supabase, where any row is shown where a value in the column matches at least one selected. 

Example: I have 4 rows of data under ""Fruits"".

- ['Apple']
- ['Banana']
- ['Apple', 'Banana']
- ['Kiwi']

I would like to filter with the following:
- ['Apple', 'Kiwi']

The returned result should be:
- ['Apple']
- ['Apple', 'Banana']
- ['Kiwi']


### Describe alternatives you've considered

Issue #5922 is similar in that it added the ability to check if an array matches an array with the `ina` and `nina` operators but differs based on the ability to match if ANY value in the filtering array matches the column array.

### Additional context

Here's a couple of examples of using the Supabse JS client to do the call:

```javascript
let { data: orders } = await supabaseClient
	.from('orders')
	.select('*')
	.or('fruits.ov.{Apple,Kiwi}');

let { data: orders2 } = await supabaseClient
	.from('orders')
	.select('*')
	.overlaps('fruits', ['Apple', 'Kiwi']);
```

### Describe the thing to improve

I believe we could follow a similar route and add ina_overlap and nina_overlap [CrudFilter](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/b6ee221234287b9fb1a94f0f948f93fbed9c5f24/packages/core/src/contexts/data/types.ts#L195) and map to [query.overlaps](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/overlaps) in [Supabase data provider](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/b6ee221234287b9fb1a94f0f948f93fbed9c5f24/packages/supabase/src/utils/generateFilter.ts#L4).",2238786059,"Hey @jim-knight, we've implemented the fix about the Windows environment.

2340301696,6022,[BUG] Cannot specify `0` as filter value in the Nestjs-Query Data Provider,"### Describe the bug

Cannot specify `0` as filter value.
Also, `""""` cannot be specified.

Because it is excluded by the conditions in the following sections.

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/a8404fc92c856f89b06684de6ad481aa840267be/packages/nestjs-query/src/utils/index.ts#L165

### Steps To Reproduce

1. create Nestjs-Query example project.

```
pnpm create refine-app@latest --example data-provider-nestjs-query
```

2. implement initial filter with a value of `0` on `src/pages/categories/list.tsx`.

```ts
  const { tableProps, sorters } = useTable<ICategory>({
    initialSorter: [
      {
        field: ""id"",
        order: ""asc"",
      },
    ],
    filters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: 'id',
          operator: 'eq',
          value: 0 
        }
      ],
    },
```

3. run refine app.

```
pnpm dev
```

4. navigate `Categories` menu.

5. GraphQL query is executed with no filter specified. (Inspect in the DevTools network panel.)

```ts
filter: {},
```

### Expected behavior

GraphQL query is executed with the following filter.

```ts
filter: {id: {eq: 0}},
```

2337854047,6020,[DOC] how to test with vitest/jest,"### Documentation issue

[The testing page](https://refine.dev/docs/further-readings/testing/) does not have any instructions on tesing with partially-implemented browser environment, like jsdom

### Describe the thing to improve

Apps built with refine can contain custom logic that needs to be tested. browser tests (e.g cypress/playwright) are a great way to make certain assertions but for other cases unit and integration tests headless testing (e.g vitest/jest) are much more apt.

When I include the `Refine` provider in a vitest environment tests start crashing with this error
![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/12392666/613ae7ca-be76-4944-bd18-591c9886400b)

The lack of testing documentation means it's very difficult to make the tests run.

```ts
import routerProvider from '@refinedev/react-router-v6';
import refineDataProvider from '@refinedev/simple-rest';
import { render, RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Refine, ResourceProps } from '@refinedev/core';
import {  ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';

export const renderApp = (
  ui: ReactElement,
  options: RenderOptions & {
    resources: ResourceProps[];
  }
) => {
  return render(ui, {
    wrapper: ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ThemeProvider>
          <Refine
            dataProvider={{

### Describe the solution (optional)

2337854047,6020,[DOC] how to test with vitest/jest,"### Documentation issue

[The testing page](https://refine.dev/docs/further-readings/testing/) does not have any instructions on tesing with partially-implemented browser environment, like jsdom

### Describe the thing to improve

Apps built with refine can contain custom logic that needs to be tested. browser tests (e.g cypress/playwright) are a great way to make certain assertions but for other cases unit and integration tests headless testing (e.g vitest/jest) are much more apt.

When I include the `Refine` provider in a vitest environment tests start crashing with this error
![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/12392666/613ae7ca-be76-4944-bd18-591c9886400b)

The lack of testing documentation means it's very difficult to make the tests run.

```ts
import routerProvider from '@refinedev/react-router-v6';
import refineDataProvider from '@refinedev/simple-rest';
import { render, RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Refine, ResourceProps } from '@refinedev/core';
import {  ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';

export const renderApp = (
  ui: ReactElement,
  options: RenderOptions & {
    resources: ResourceProps[];
  }
) => {
  return render(ui, {
    wrapper: ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ThemeProvider>
          <Refine
            dataProvider={{

",2161025550,"Hey @borisyordanov, thank you for opening the issue and writing an explanation for your case 🙏 Adding a documentation section for vitest/jest testing and adding an example will be great for many users imho 🤔 

Thank you for sharing your solution for the `@refinedev/mui` + `vitest` error 🙏 This is related with how we do imports from `@mui/*` packages, I'm not sure if there's any way that works for every platform in both ESM and CJS but maybe we can transform these imports for ESM and CJS bundles to make sure the imports are pointing to correct files with correct shape 🚀 

Same issue also occurs when using Material UI with Remix in SPA mode (https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/6007). Unfortunately, Material UI has some issues with ESM exports (https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/30671), until they resolve those issues we will try to have workaround to get past them in our `@refinedev/mui` package.

https://gyazo.com/ddf4cef3fa74d7d1665795d438f33fdd

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Just create a refine app with the CLI npm create-refine-app
2. I used headless and Appwrite

### Expected behavior

It should not be infinitely loading.

Hey, under mobile `<ThemedSiderV2>` is a button popup, but I've found that it can somewhat obscure the content of the page, in this case it's a problem on all pages, and a bit worse on the `create` and `edit` pages due to the presence of the breadcrumbs, I've taken a screenshot of an example from the docs:

2299559310,5954,[FEAT] Have an optional to reset from when close modal inside `useModalForm`,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Hi, I would like to have option to reset the form value to `defaultValues` when use `close()` in `useModalForm` hooks.

There are 2 issues, I'm facing:

- When using create `useModalForm({refineCoreProps:{action: 'create'})` I want to reset the form when user just `close()` (cancel by chance) and when user open modal again, the previous value is still there. 
- When using edit `useModalForm({refineCoreProps:{action: 'edit'})`, when close modal and open another modal by call `show(id)`, the previous data is still inside the new modal and waiting to replace after fetch is completed. This will make user experience confuse sometimes when the internet is slow. 


To bypass the issue, we call `reset()` then `close()`.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

It would be nice to have another option inside `useModalForm` when user want to reset form after closing the form not just by summitted. For example 

```ts
useModalForm({
    refineCoreProps: { action: 'create' },
    defaultValues,
    modalProps: {
      autoResetFormWhenClose: true // <-- something like this
    }
    resolver: valibotResolver(schema)
  });

2299232369,5953,[BUG] Arrows directions in RTL (Right to Left),"### Describe the bug

Arrows used for navigation are always pointing to the same direction as LTR, regardless of the UI direction (LTR or RTL). This can be confusing for users navigating the UI in RTL mode, where the expectation is for the arrows to point to the different direction.

![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/54387513/cc047762-c447-4691-9b45-ce5cbdec9503)


### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set the UI direction to RTL (Right-to-Left) in your Refinejs project.
2. Navigate to any page containing one or more arrows used for navigation
3. Observe that the arrows are all pointing to the same direction as LTR.

### Expected behavior

In RTL mode, the arrows used for navigation should be flipped so that they point to the opposite direction. This would be consistent with the user's expectation when navigating a right-to-left UI.

2291432035,5943,[FEAT] Default GraphQL DataProvider cannot function on deeper graphs,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, the [default GraphQL DataProvider](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/3046f9610f647bb049dbd388cd8cd5c267b481fa/packages/graphql/src/dataProvider/index.ts) is not capable of handling complex object graphs (which is very common in GraphQL). It appears to make the assumption that any query will be designed such that it returns the intended data type at the root level of the response. But this is very frequently not the case with GraphQL. 

E.g. 

```graphql
query {
  userPosts(userId: 'me') {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

But as is typically the case with GraphQL endpoints, they may not expose highly focused queries such as that, and you may have something along the lines of this, which is still very simplistic but contains the desired data only a single level deeper.

```graphql
query {
  user(userId: 'me') {
    posts {
      id
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

Unfortunately this is not possible with the current DataProvider. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I propose amending the [GraphQLQueryOptions](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/3046f9610f647bb049dbd388cd8cd5c267b481fa/packages/core/src/contexts/data/types.ts#L49-L99) type with a `gqlDataPath` and a `gqlCountPath` properties. These would be an array of strings that tell the DataProvider how to reach the intended data from the response. 

An additional utils function could be added that would then take this path (if provided) and extract the intended object(s) for use in the response, e.g...

```typescript
const getProp = (obj: any, path: (string | number)[], defaultValue: any = undefined): any =>
  path.reduce((acc: any, key: string | number) => acc && acc[key] !== undefined ? acc[key] : defaultValue, obj);
```

Then the returned result could be derived as so...

```typescript
return {
  data: meta?.gqlDataPath ? getProp(meta.gqlDataPath) : response[operation],
  total: meta?.gqlCountPath ? getProp(meta.gqlCountPath): response[operation].count
}
```

This gives the default GraphQL DataProvider the ability to handle more than the most basic of response types. In my experience, one of the primary purposes of graphQL is to expose deeper, more complex graphs of data precisely because the data owners may not be aware of how clients intend to use it. It's likely not possible to expose rudimentary endpoints for every possible use case. GitHub's GraphQL endpoint is an excellent example of this. ",,
2290961101,5942,[BUG] Default GraphQL DataProvider GetListResponse from 'count' property not possible.,"### Describe the bug

The default GraphQL providers `getList` function return the following `GetListResponse` shaped object: 

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/3046f9610f647bb049dbd388cd8cd5c267b481fa/packages/graphql/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L39-L42

As [mentioned by another user on Discord](https://discord-questions.refine.dev/m/1205328662510047242) (possibly @Karabur?), this does not make sense. In order for `getList` to function correctly with various integration points within Refine (like the MUI `useDataGrid` hook), `response[operation]` must return an array of objects. An array cannot have additional properties on it such as `count`.  I'm not sure I understand how anybody could be using this default data provider out of the box with working pagination. 

### Steps To Reproduce

N/A. Per the graphQL spec, a list cannot have additional properties. 

### Expected behavior

I do not see how any GraphQL API could provide a response that would provide working pagination for the default GraphQL provider. Even the [docs for useList indicate something considerably different](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-list/#retrieving-the-total-row-count), more akin to a [Relay response](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm).

2285934422,5933,Date range table filter in Ant Design is broken,"### Describe the bug

Hi everyone, while trying to replicate the Ant Design Crm example I noticed that the date range filter doesn't work as it should: https://example.crm.refine.dev/administration/audit-log.

When filtering by the ""Date & Time"" column and subsequently reloading the page, the following error occurs:
```
invalid input syntax for type timestamp: ""0NaN-NaN-NaNTNaN:NaN:NaN.NaN+NaN:NaN""
Error (status code: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
```

Then if you try to filter the same column again, the application will crash.

Other types of filters work properly, so I think that there might be something wrong with the conversion of the date values from the url to CrudFilter objects or vice-versa.

Here's a video of the bug:

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/49818192/fe591efd-d17c-46b5-b9ed-3197b8700270



### Steps To Reproduce

1. Visit: https://example.crm.refine.dev/administration/audit-log.
2. Filter the ""Date & Time"" column by a range of dates.
3. Reload the page and an error will be thrown.
4. Then try to filter by the ""Date & Time"" column again and the app will crash.

### Expected behavior

Upon reloading the page with the same URL, the ""Date & Time"" column should be filtered with valid dates, and the query should function correctly.

2278826042,5916,[DOC]: clarify rowCount retrieval and improve pagination examples,"### Documentation issue

The issue relates to existing sections of the documentation concerning data fetching hooks. The current documentation lacks explicit details on how Refine retrieves the total row count for paginated data via the `x-total-count` header.

**Links to relevant sections:**
1. [useList Hook Documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-list/)
2. [useInfiniteList Hook Documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-infinite-list/)
3. [Cursor-Based Pagination Guide in `useInfiniteList`](https://refine.dev/docs/data/hooks/use-infinite-list/#how-to-use-cursor-based-pagination)

### Describe the thing to improve

Currently, the Refine documentation lacks explicit information on how the `rowCount` for paginated data is retrieved from server-side pagination. More specifically:

- It isn't clear how Refine determines `rowCount` if it's not explicitly provided by the backend.
- Developers may be confused regarding the behaviour of the `useList` and `useInfiniteList` hooks with server-side pagination.
- The documentation does not provide sufficient details on the use of the `x-total-count` header or fallback mechanisms for obtaining the total count of rows.

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. **Clarify Documentation in Hook Guides:**
   - Add a dedicated section to the `useList` and `useInfiniteList` hook guides explaining how the total row count is retrieved using the `x-total-count` header.
   - Include examples or code snippets demonstrating proper usage.

2. **Update Data Fetching Guide:**
   - In the data fetching guide, provide a thorough explanation of the `getList` method and how it handles paginated data and total row count retrieval.
   - Explain the fallback mechanism used if the `x-total-count` header is absent.

These additions will provide clear guidance to developers on how Refine determines the `rowCount` and how to ensure accurate pagination data is fetched.

### Describe the solution (optional)

To improve the experience of beginners and readers, consider these solutions:

1. **Add Detailed Explanations:**
   - **Hook Guides:** Include a new sub-section in the `useList` and `useInfiniteList` hook guides specifically covering how Refine retrieves the `rowCount` from the `x-total-count` header during server-side pagination. Make it clear how the total count is obtained, even when not directly provided by the backend, and describe the fallback mechanism.
   - **Data Fetching Guide:** Update the guide to include a step-by-step explanation of the `getList` method's behavior. Emphasize its role in data retrieval, including how it ensures accurate pagination.

2. **Provide Code Examples:**
   - Add practical examples demonstrating how the `x-total-count` header is used within a real-world data provider implementation, including cursor-based pagination.
   - Highlight the fallback logic when the header is absent, providing best practices for consistent data retrieval.

3. **Cross-Link Pages:**
   - Ensure consistent cross-referencing between the hooks documentation and the data fetching guide so readers can easily find all relevant details.

4. **General Grammar Fixes:**
   - Review the existing documentation for minor grammar issues and fix where appropriate.",,
2278814015,5915,[FEAT] Serving from a subdirectory,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

In refine 3.x it was possible to configure the router to specify a base path:
[Docs - Serving the application from a subdirectory](https://refine.dev/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/#routercomponent)

Its useful to be able to do this on a large site comprising multiple apps each of which has its own basepath.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Prefixing resource paths and routes works as a workaround.

2275432254,5909,[BUG] Supabase token refresh not handled in Next.js example,"### Describe the bug

When automatically creating a project with `npm create refine-app@latest` using Next.js and Supabase, the authProvider creates a copy of the token created at login time. `Cookies.set(""token"", data.session.access_token, {expires: 30, path: ""/"",});`. This does not take into account the need to refresh the token (which supabase internally does in the client, storing it in local storage).

We use a graphql setup with an inferencer to generate CRUD screens using Material UI.
When using the inferencer all the form fields get flagged as 'required'. Since we want to automate the project as much as possible, having to manually remove these required flags is very undesired.
Looking at the source code you can find some hardcoded config on the form fields:

2262004584,5888,[BUG] `mutationOptions` are overriding Refine's behavior unexpectedly,"### Describe the bug

Consider this:

```tsx
import { useLogin } from ""@refinedev/core"";

const { mutateAsync: login, isLoading } = useLogin({
    mutationOptions: {
        onSuccess(data) {
         console.log(""Hey!"");
        },
    },
});
```

And `authProvider.ts` as follow:

```tsx
""use client"";

import { AuthBindings, HttpError } from ""@refinedev/core"";

export const authProvider: AuthBindings = {
    login: async ({ username, password }) => {
        try {
            // Preform login
            return { success: true, redirectTo: ""/"" };
        } catch (error) {
            return {
                success: false,
                error: { message: ""Username or password is incorrect"", statusCode: (error as HttpError).statusCode },
            };
        }
    },
};
```


Then `onSuccess` callback on `useLogin` will override the Refine's behavior for `onSuccess` causing the `redirectTo` to not work.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a login component
2. Create an `authProvider`
3. Add a custom `onSuccess` callback in `useLogin({ mutationOptions: onSuccess() { /* callback */ }});`
4. Redirect doesn't happen after successful login

### Expected behavior

`mutationOptions` should work along side the Refine's default behavior, redirect should occur.

Configure non-CURD pages in i18n configuration file",,
2254633795,5872,[FEAT] Unable to highlight non-CRUD page on menu item,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Hi, I'm having a confusing time on how to highlight non-CURD pages to the left menu items and display the breadcrumb navigation properly?

I now have a usage scenario: there is an order placing function in the member module that is not part of the member's CURD, and this order placing function only requires a create page.

Currently my needs are that I want to highlight this page to the Member menu in the left menu item, and I want that new page to be consistent with the breadcrumb navigation like the one that creates the member, and since I need the member's ID, maybe I should just need an edit page?

Is it now possible to fix the issue in the resources config item? I asked Refine Docs AI and didn't find a solution, if there is a solution please let me know, my code is similar to this: 

```js
const resources = [
 {
    name: 'vip',
    list: '/vip',
    create: '/vip/create',
    edit: '/vip/edit/:id',
    meta: {
      label: 'Member',
      icon: <CrownOutlined />,
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'vipOrder',
    list: '/vip',
    edit: '/vip/order/:id',
    meta: {
      parent: 'vip',
      hide: true,
    },
  }
]
```

Thanks, team

2250534424,5864,[FEAT] Passing arbitrary graphql variables to hasura dataProvider,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I am very pleased that gqlQuery allows us to perform arbitrary GraphQL Queries against hasura.
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/5489

However, it is not possible to use hasura's powerful filters because only CrudFilter[] can be passed to filters in the useTable. It is also not possible to use variables type information generated by graphql codegen.

In my case.
Given a type with the relation User has many Books, I can write a query in hasura to get a list of Users who have 3 or more Books, which is not possible in the current CrudFilter.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

added to the following line in hasura dataProvider.
```typescript
        variables = {
          ...hasuraPagination,
          ...(hasuraSorting &&
            (namingConvention === ""graphql-default""
              ? {
                orderBy: hasuraSorting,
              }
              : {
                order_by: hasuraSorting,
              })),
          ...(hasuraFilters && {
            where: hasuraFilters,
          }),
          ...(meta?.gqlVariables && meta?.gqlVariables), // added
        };
```
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/hasura/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L181


This allows the addition of any where condition supported by hasura, using type information hints, as follows.
```typescript
  const { tableProps } = useTable<GetFieldsFromList<BlogPostsQuery>>({
    syncWithLocation: true,
    meta: {
      gqlQuery: BlogPostsDocument,
      gqlVariables: {
        where: {

![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/110831700/69e06ddf-ac70-4e9e-a738-a7f72cf4ddd4)

when trying to implement multiple top level `conditionalFilter` using `@refinedev/react-table`'s useTable.


### Steps To Reproduce


Create a table using `@refinedev/react-table`'s useTable.

use the `and` filterOperator for the columns with date values.

```tsx
  const columns = React.useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        id: 'createdAt',
        header: 'CreatedAt',
        accessorKey: 'createdAt',

        },
        meta: {

  )

  const [columnVisibility, setColumnVisibility] =

  )

      columnVisibility,
      columnFilters,
    },
    onColumnVisibilityChange: setColumnVisibility,
    onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters,
  })
```

use [setFilterValue](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/features/column-filtering#setfiltervalue) for setting the column filter values. 

set the filter value by doing something like:
```tsx
// more react here
        <Calendar
          initialFocus
          mode=""range""
          defaultMonth={date?.from}
          selected={date}
          onSelect={(newDateRange) => {
            setFilterValue([
              { field, operator: 'gte', value: newDateRange.from },
              { field, operator: 'lte', value: newDateRange.to },
            ])
            setDate(newDateRange)
          }}
          numberOfMonths={2}
        />
// more react here
```


### My Problem


after setting a filter for the `createdAt` column, my columnFilters` value is:
```json
[
    {
        ""id"": ""createdAt"",
        ""value"": [
            {
                ""field"": ""createdAt"",
                ""operator"": ""gte"",
                ""value"": ""2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z""
            },
            {
                ""field"": ""createdAt"",
                ""operator"": ""lte"",
                ""value"": ""2024-04-18T16:00:00.000Z""
            }
        ]
    },
]
```
and the `filters` value I get in my dataprovider's getList is:

```ts
[
  {
    field: 'createdAt',
    operator: 'and',
    value: [
      {
        field: 'createdAt',
        operator: 'gte',
        value: '2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z',
      },
      {
        field: 'createdAt',
        operator: 'lte',
        value: '2024-04-19T16:00:00.000Z',
      },
    ],
  },
]
```
but when I add another conditionalFilter for the `updatedAt` column, the conditionalFilters error arises:

![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/110831700/b28c3d92-bb24-4ac8-bdf0-c9f20c8417d6)

### Expected Behavior

I expect we should have an option of providing `key` values to useTable's columnFilters. that way we could remove the `conditionalFilter` error in the console.

### Packages

    ""@refinedev/core"": ""^4.48.0"",
    ""@refinedev/react-table"": ""^5.6.7"",

### Additional Context

Just for the sake of testing, I also tried hardcoding filters with key values in columnFilters, but i am still getting the same error.

```tsx
  const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = React.useState([
    {
      key: 'createdAt-filter',
      id: 'createdAt',
      value: [
        {
          field: 'createdAt',
          operator: 'gte',
          value: '2024-04-15T16:00:00.000Z',
        },
        {

### Additional Context

I've created another simple component, `ResourceUseQuerySelect`, that uses just the `useQuery `hook and makes requests via `datasource.getList`. It seems to have the correct behavior for requesting data.
Both components are used on the same page and form.

Upd: I've tried to call `useList` hook in the component, and it duplicates requests too. It looks like there might be something wrong with the useList hook because, under the hood, it uses useQuery, which works fine.

I also tested in prod mode, and non strict mode.

2236366111,5840,"[DOC] Improve DevTools documentation (manual configuration, login, etc.)","### Documentation issue

I am using a Nx monorepo workspace. I wanted to use `@refinedev/devtools` while keeping my workflow. The documentation make it looks that it is possible (such as [tutorial](https://refine.dev/tutorial/next-steps/devtools/) manual installation section, or the [development guide](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/development/#using-devtools) also).

However, I was greeted with a `Could not connect to the devtools server`. I was perplexed since I don't remember seeing in the docs that a server is needed, neither other devtools I used before required a separated server. Anyhow, after some deep dive the in source code and trying to search around the docs, I learned that the devtools do need a standalone server that is started by the [`@refinedev/cli` `dev` command](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/development/#usage).

Since I am not using the CLI, I looked deeper in the source code to figure out how `@refinedev/cli` start the devtools. I was able to find out that to start manually the devtools, I need to install the internal package `@refinedev/devtools-server`, which provides a `refine-devtools` binary that can start the devtools server.

So, I ran `pnpm exec refine-devtools` to launch it. Refresh my frontend, open the devtools panel to be greated by a Login page!?! Nowhere in the documentation mention the needs for a login to Google or Github to be able to use the devtools. This point to me that the devtools might include some [telemetry that is not documented](https://refine.dev/docs/further-readings/telemetry/)? Or the devtools uses some kind of cloud-based storage/process to provide its features?

While searching for more information, I saw the following call made in the network of the developper tools in Chrome:
- `ws://localhost:5002/` : The devtools server is running on port 5001. Why port 5002 is needed?
- `cloud2.refine.dev`: This one was not in the network tab, I had to use a network sniffer...

I was already irrated that using the devtools is so complicated to use (even if its a beta), but seeing that a Google or Github login is required for a local devtools is making me reconsider my choice of using Refine.

Also, while searching around, I found those links that bring to dead end.

### Describe the thing to improve

### A) Basic Usage

For the basic usage of the devtools, document that when doing the manual installation, the devtools requires a standalone server that is usually started by using the commands offered in `@refinedev/cli` package.

### B) Usage without `@refinedev/cli`

For usage without `@refinedev/cli`, document that the standalone server can be started manually by installing the `@refinedev/devtools-server` package and then running `pnpm exec refine-devtools` (or the equivalent with npm or yarn).

### C) Login with Google/Github

Explain clearly why the login is required and what information is collected, which non-local backend is used, for what an external backend is used, etc.

### D) Telemetry

If required, update the telemetry page to document which data the devtools server is capturing.

https://refine.dev/blog/shadcn-ui/#refine--shadcn-building-a-reusable-datatable--component-with-shadcn

This doc does not seem to work, i followed the instructions and i get an error after implementing the Datatable component.

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'categoryData')

checking the table object from

{
        id: ""category"",
        header: ""Category"",

this column section, i can see that table does not have a meta under options object..

is this document outdated?

### Steps To Reproduce

Follow the instructions on the documentation.

### Expected behavior

should work. instead i get an error and nothing is shown on the page.

At [useInfiniteList](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/core/src/hooks/data/useInfiniteList.ts#L253) is missing the default value for pageParam, setting `pageParam = preferredPagination.current ?? 1` seems to fix it.

queryFn: ({ queryKey, pageParam, signal }) => {
      const paginationProperties = {
        ...prefferedPagination,
        current: pageParam,
      };
```


### Steps To Reproduce

1. define a useInfiniteList hook
```
    const {
        data,
        isError,
        isLoading,
        hasNextPage,
        fetchNextPage,

            mode: ""server""
        },
    });
```

2. Test it, we are using the nestjs-query for our graphql apis
3. You will see that the paging field is not passed as argument for the query, because `paginationProperties.current` is overriden by `pageParam` (always undefined)

Pagination to work

After an upgrade to 4.49.0, TypeScript is not able to figure out the imports: `Module '""@refinedev/core""' has no exported member 'useTranslate'.ts(2305)`.

So far, in my codebase, the following elements are not being processed by TypeScript:
- Authenticated
- useLogin
- useTranslate
- useIsAuthenticated
- useLogout
- useGetLocale
- useSetLocale 
- useTranslate
- Refine

The following elements seems to be imported correctly by TypeScript:
- AuthProvider
- RefineProps
- I18nProvider
- ResourceProps

When using the register authpage in combination with i18n, the default auth page is using the wrong key for the ""Already have an account"" text. It uses `pages.login.buttons.haveAccount` even tho in the i18n translation file offered by the refine documentation has that key in the `pages.register.buttons.haveAccount`. This should be changed so it matches `pages.login.buttons.noAccount`

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a refine project (for example vite)

3. Switch languages to a non-english language
4. See the register page

2218715101,5809,[FEAT]  Deep Filtering on Nested JSON Fields in Supabase,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I'm currently working on a project using Refine with Supabase as the data provider. I have a use case where I need to filter data based on a nested JSON field. However, it seems that Refine does not support deep filtering on nested JSON fields out of the box.

Here's a snippet of my current implementation:

```jsx
const {{ tableProps, searchFormProps }} = useTable({{
  onSearch: (values: any) => {{
    return [
      {{
        field: ""data->>'spanish'"",
        operator: ""contains"",
        value: values.value,
      }},
    ];
  }},
}});

2216779528,5803,[BUG] env utility breaks Vite dotenv conventions,"### Describe the bug

Vite uses dotenv (and a plugin or two) to load values from files with the following conventions:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```

Additionally, it behaves according to the following description:

> An env file for a specific mode (e.g. .env.production) will take higher priority than a generic one (e.g. .env).
> 
> In addition, environment variables that already exist when Vite is executed have the highest priority and will not be overwritten by .env files.

([reference](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode))

The Refine CLI automatically loads values in the `.env` file which appear to persist in the environment when executing the Vite commands (i.e. `vite dev`).

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/16eefc493da3e66a095a11d9dcbeff0ec64dca57/packages/cli/src/utils/env/index.ts#L3

These take precedence and effectively break the `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc. conventions of Vite.

CRA has slightly different but similar conventions. I assume the Refine CLI would be affecting it similarly?

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a Refine/Vite project.
2. Create a `.env` file with the content `VITE_TITLE=production`.
3. Create a `.env.development` file with the content `VITE_TITLE=development`.
4. Run `npm run refine dev`.
5. Observe the value of `import.meta.env.VITE_TITLE` is ""production"", not ""development"".

### Expected behavior

The Refine CLI shouldn't break Vite's dotenv conventions. In the trivial example provided, the value of `import.meta.env.VITE_TITLE` should be ""development"" from the `.env.development` file.

- ""@refinedev/react-router-v6"": ""4.5.6""
- ""vite"": ""5.2.7""
- package manager: Yarn 4.1.1 w/ node_modules linker

### Additional Context

I explicitly renamed my `.env` file to `.env.production` to ""workaround"" the issue. That file appears to not be loaded by the Refine CLI, and then my app builds as expected. It's an unfortunate workaround, effectively forcing us to not use the `.env` file and ""layering"" of settings.",,

2214215361,5797,[DOC] Documenting that `@refinedev/react-router-v6` is working with `<RouterProvider>` also,"### Documentation issue

In their v6.4, `react-router-dom` added an alternative to the Router Components (like the know [`<BrowserRouter>`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/browser-router) by using a [`<RouterProvider>`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/router-provider) with [data API routers](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router).

All documentation of its [integration](https://refine.dev/docs/routing/integrations/react-router/) (there are also example code shown [here](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/routing/#react-router) and [there](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/routing/#router-integrations)) in Refine uses the `<BrowserRouter>` method.

### Describe the thing to improve

The doc should be improved to document the fact that using `<RouterProvider>`, with a [`createBrowserRouter()`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) is supported and works out of the box (at least, according to #4715 and my limited usage for now[^1]).

Also, it is not clear how all these data apis interact with the integration, including the [loaders](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/loader), [fetchers](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher) and [actions](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/action). They seems to provide features that overlap somewhat with Refine.

[^1]: I don't know if there is some smoke tests for `@refinedev/react-router-v6`, but maybe adding some more using the `<RouterProvider>` could be useful?

### Describe the solution (optional)

I think a quick win would be to show the [Basic Usage](https://refine.dev/docs/routing/integrations/react-router/#basic-usage) example with tabs, one with the current code and one using the `<RouterProvider>`. Here what it could look like, using the [migration guide they provide](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/v6-data). I did not test the code, simply applied the migration guide.

how to override these default permissions in appwrite dataProvider? I don't want public permissions, only the permissions i set in meta at creation/edition.

2189333721,5757,[BUG] Table pagination example is flawed,"### Describe the bug

https://refine.dev/docs/examples/table/mui/cursor-pagination/

Firstly this example only works one direction. The back button just moves forward further.

Secondly, by taking this approach, changing filters or sort breaks the ""current page"" referenced. The `${pagestart} - ${pageEnd}` count will be inaccurate. 

I don't have a solution for cursor pagination, but this example is not something people should try to use. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to https://refine.dev/docs/examples/table/mui/cursor-pagination/
2. Click the next arrow
3. click the prev arrow
4. Note the timestamps only go in one direction

### Expected behavior

previous button in pagination works. And there is an example with the datagrid that works properly.

2175961383,5734,[BUG] Remix (SPA) Support,"### Describe the bug

The current build process of refine packages makes it incompatible with Remix SPA, and possibly? more.

This has been tested on Remix 2.8.0.

The following steps need to be taken:

- Disable minify on all repos in tsup `esbuildOptions` via `options.minify = false;` (remix SPA does a sort-of 1 time SSR eval, running `Refine` through a node-js server which needs the ESM import, unminified)
- Disable tsbuild `--legacyOutput`.
- Add export maps with the esm `import` pointing to a `.mjs` file (this actually really matters)
  - Ensure export maps have typings as well.
- Replace `lodash-es` and `papaparse` at a minimum to use `.js` extensions when imported
- Update commands in `packages/cli/src/commands/runner` as `remix-serve` no longer exists and needs to use `remix vite:*`?

You can see a debug branch with many of these changes at https://github.com/LumeWeb/refine/tree/remix for reference.

To improve the user experience, we can add jump links (also known as anchor links or hash links) to the README.md file. Jump links are clickable elements that allow users to navigate directly to a specific section of the document.

- Improved usability: Jump links make it easier for users to find the information they need quickly.

- Enhanced accessibility: Jump links can be helpful for users with disabilities who may find it difficult to scroll through long documents.

Currently, refine.dev provides separate views for showing, editing, and creating records. While this modular approach is useful in many cases, it can sometimes result in duplicated code when the same fields and layout are required for both creating and editing records. To address this concern and promote a more streamlined development process, I suggest the introduction of a new view type, which I would like to call the ""Form View"" or ""Record View.""

The Form View or Record View would serve as a unified view that combines the functionalities of creating, editing, and showing records. Developers could use this single view for all operations related to a particular record, reducing the need for duplicate code and ensuring a more maintainable codebase.

I have begun working on the implementation of this feature. As part of this process, I encountered the need to refactor prop types, such as creating RefineCrudFormProps like RefineCrudEditProps. I also had to create FormProps like EditProps for libraries like Ant Design. While progressing, I've faced some challenges in finding the optimal approach to tackle this.

The useForm() hook in refine.dev already supports action, allowing developers to pass information on whether it's an edit or create operation. For instance, one can specify ""edit"" if a record ID exists and ""create"" if it doesn't. This provides a flexible mechanism to handle different scenarios within the unified Form View.

The show functionality can be integrated into the edit form, with a state toggle to enable or disable editing.

Feel free to suggest alternative approaches, highlight potential challenges, or discuss additional features that could enhance the proposed Form View.

2148459362,5667,[BUG] `onFinish` promise is never rejected,"### Describe the bug

If there is a mutation error, the `onFinish` promise is supposed to be rejected but right now the Promise never finishes because the `reject` function is not called:
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/ae34559a5e44a878e85514d4cc137539e060aeae/packages/core/src/hooks/form/useForm.ts#L461-L464

(same applies for the error handler of update)

I think either the reject function should be passed to the `onMutationError` handler or the reject function should be called in every case.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Submit a form that throws a mutation error
2. Check if the `onFinish` handler rejects 

### Expected behavior

The `onFinish` handler should not only resolve but also reject in case of any errors.

2141024191,5655,[BUG] Supabase useImport onSucces failure,"### Describe the bug

I'm using useImport and it imports the records correctly but is throwing an error: ""Cannot read properties of null (reading 'filter')"". I tracked it down to the createMany API call. I'm using supabase and it returns an empty body. But the useCreateMany hook is expecting a body and so is trying to filter a null value. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Add useImport hook
2. Import records
3. Add onFinish handler to catch errors

### Expected behavior

Success response returned since records are imported correctly

Given an OpenAPI spec, we should be able to codegen pages. We can later tune them for our own efficiency, but at the bare minimum it should easily handle CRUD. Codegen clients are a common practice with good specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, etcetera.

Obviously this entails writing a nice API backend, but given projects like Swagger, OpenAPI 3.0, Etcetera, this is now a reality.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

I may have skimmed over the docs. If there's any remotely possible way I can do this right now, I'd love to know. 

I'm currently manually writing the pages (ew!). I'm considering building my own codegen, because a project I'm building has like 20 API routes.

Here's a codegen for RTK Query which I frequently use to build API clients: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/code-generation

To address all issues, run:

I attempted to run `npm audit fix`. It fixed some depricated packages but it didn't resolve the issue of vulnerabilities. Consequently, I added `--force` option; However, this wasn't effective as well.

Again, I attempted to delete *node-modules* and *package-lock.json* and running `npm i`. Yet again the issue persisted. I believe some of these packages are being used internally by refine.

2086525982,5529,[DOC] AuthProvider updated on v4 but not reflected on docs,"### Documentation issue

I've come across numerous examples utilizing the AuthProvider typing:

[What is Auth Provider](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/understanding-authprovider/index/#what-is-auth-provider)
[Creating a Mock Auth Provider](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/understanding-authprovider/create-authprovider/#creating-a-mock-auth-provider)

However, in the migration tutorial, specifically [here](https://refine.dev/docs/migration-guide/auth-provider/#naming-changes), there seems to be a discrepancy. The [migration guide from 3.x to 4.x](https://refine.dev/docs/migration-guide/3x-to-4x/#authprovider) provides different information. When attempting to import:

```js
import type { AuthProvider } from ""@refinedev/core"";
```

TypeScript returns the following error: '""@refinedev/core""' has no exported member named 'AuthProvider'. Did you mean 'OAuthProvider'?ts(2724)

Upon inspecting the typings inside the core, I found a slight difference from the documentation:

<img width=""790"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/11761170/369b9ce7-da29-4ad0-afa4-db5a00083f21"">

Should we update the AuthProvider in examples and code to AuthBindings, or is it necessary to continue using LegacyAuthProvider for now? On examples and documentation.

I'm using the following packages:

tsc can't find the type definition of `@refinedev/inferencer/*` so that we couldn't import the packages. The error message is below:

```
TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module '@refinedev/inferencer/mantine'. '/tmp/tmp.gIbEnmIS6x/node_modules/@refinedev/inferencer/dist/esm/mantine.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.

```

### Steps To Reproduce

First, `cd $(mktemp -d)`

Place these files:

2082617183,5517,[BUG] useDataGrid and syncWithLocation set to true triggers the same request twice,"### Describe the bug

When using the useDataGrid hook for mui, and setting an initial sort along with the `syncWithLocation` set to true the same request gets sent twice:

```
useDataGrid({
    initialCurrent: 1,
    initialPageSize: 10,
    sorters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: ""Name"",
          order: ""asc"",
        },
      ],
    },
    syncWithLocation: true,
    ...
```

What happens is the initial request gets made, then the URL is synced, and the second (same) request is triggered because the `meta` that is sent to the dataProvider has the following information in it:

```
meta: {
      ""sorters[0][field]"": ""Name"",
      ""sorters[0][order]"": ""asc"",
      ...
```

If i set those same keys in the `useDataGrid` hook then there is only a single request made.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run refine with mui and use the `useDataGrid` hook
2. Set an initial sort
3. Set syncWithLocation to true
4. Load page and monitor your network. A second duplicate request will be made to the API

### Expected behavior

Setting initial sort value should immediately sync to the meta key in order to prevent the second request. Or an alternative method to eliminate this second duplicate request.

2080323557,5509,[DOC] Query in code tutorial not reflects api url example,"### Documentation issue

I'm following the tutorial documentation, and I noticed that some code does not align with the provided examples. This discrepancy may confuse users going through the tutorial.

For instance, in the getList example found here: https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/understanding-dataprovider/create-dataprovider/#getlist, the API params example is given as follows:

[GET] https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev/posts?_limit=10&_page=2

However, in the code below this example, a variable is created as follows:
```js
...
const { current = 1, pageSize = 10 } = pagination ?? {};

const query: {
    _start?: number;
    _end?: number;
} = {
    _start: (current - 1) * pageSize,
    _end: current * pageSize,
};
...
```
I've tested both sets of parameters in the API URL, and they both work but return different results.

Could we use the same parameters in each example, or is there any issue with this approach?

To improve the developer experience, support for `meta.gqlQuery` and `meta.qglMutation` should be added to the `@refinedev/hasura` data provider.

import gql from ""graphql-tag"";

const PRODUCTS_QUERY = gql`
  query ProductsList(
    $offset: Int.
    $limit: Int!

    where: $where
  ) {
    products(offset: $paging, limit: $filter, order_by: $order_by, where: $where) {

    }
  }

### Describe the thing to improve

1- Add `successNotification` field to [`AuthActionResponse` type](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/core/src/interfaces/bindings/auth.ts).

```ts
type SuccessNotificationResponse {
  message: string;

    success: boolean;
    redirectTo?: string;
    error?: RefineError | Error;
    [key: string]: unknown;
    successNotification?: SuccessNotificationResponse
};
```

2-) Update relevant hooks to show success notification when `successNotification` object is provided and **add specs**.

- `useForgotPassword`
- `useLogin`
- `useLogout`
- `useRegister`
- `useUpdatePassword`

3-) Update relevant documentation pages.",,
2065143087,5472,[FEAT] Ability to configure `useCan`'s queryOptions globally and through `CanAccess` component.,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, `useCan` hook already accepts `queryOptions` parameter. This is useful when users wants to modify `cacheTime` or `staleTime` options to improve performance.

However, currently it's not possible to modify queryOptions for `CanAccess` component, or UI components using `CanAccess` under the hood, such as `EditButton` of `@refinedev`'s `antd`, `mui`, `mantine`, `chakra-ui` packages.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

It's possible to swizzle these components and update their `useCan` calls, but that's irreversible and overkill, just to cache AC queries.

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

1-) Global Configuration

Update `AccessControlProvider` interface to accept optional `queryOptions`.

```tsx
<Refine ....
  accessControlProvider={{
    can: ....
    options: {
      queryOptions: {  staleTime: 5000 //  UseQueryOptions<CanReturnType> }
    }  
  }}
```

2-) Component prop

Add `queryOptions` prop to `CanAccess` component.

```tsx
<CanAccess queryOptions={{ cacheTime: 25000 }} />
```


Checklist:
- Refactor `useCan` hook to respect `queryOptions` in the following prioritization order if provided: `hook parameter -> component prop -> global config`
- Add new specs.
- Update relevant documentation sections.",,

2062058414,5461,[BUG] Server side errors are not propagated properly,"### Describe the bug

If a value in the form is a form of object, a server side error will have the field but when propagating those errors to the fields, Refine tries to use the nested field.

### Steps To Reproduce

Let's say we have these fields `name` and `category`, `name` being a string and category being an object with `id` property.

Errors from the server side will be:

```tsx
{
  errors: {
    ""category"": ""category is required"",
  }
}
```

If the value is sent like:

```tsx
{
  category: {
    id: 5,
  }
}
```

Refine will look for errors for the field name `category.id` and fail to propagate errors to the `category` field.

### Expected behavior

Errors should be propagated properly to the fields.

2061077062,5460,[BUG] useForm onFinishUpdate promise never settles when in pessimistic mutationMode,"### Describe the bug

The useForm hook is used with mutationMode set to ""pessimistic"" and the update mutation from the data provider rejects.
The issue in the code is here:  https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/core/src/hooks/form/useForm.ts#L581
In that code path, the promise executor returns without ever calling reject (nor resolve) so the promise is never settled. This means the onFinish function never rejects (nor resolves) and it also means the underlying react-hook-form state remains with `isSumitting` as true indefinitely.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Implement a component with useForm configured with mutationMode set to ""pessimistic""
2. Add a then and catch to the onFinish method with console log statements to tell when its promise resolves or rejects
3. Add a console log to log the isSubmitting form state on every render of the component
4. Submit a form update mutation that fails (rejecting the promise)
5. Monitor the isSubmitting form state, noting that it remains true
6. Note the log statements from the onFinish resolve nor reject are ever called

### Expected behavior

The promise returned by onFinish should reject and the form state should revert to isSubmitting set to false.
A simple fix would be to just remove the ""return"" from line 581 so that `reject` is called after `onMutationError` executes. 
(Perhaps reject should be called with the error passed in as an argument, but that may be a bigger and undesired change.)

2060297201,5458,[BUG] useRegister() deletes register form data values other than email and password,"### Describe the bug

I was trying to customize RegisterPage to add Name and Company fields to the registration form. I confirmed the parameters passed to useRegister containing name and company fields but when the request was on the fly, only email and password are submitted. Is it impossible to add additional fields in Register Page?

### Steps To Reproduce

/*RegisterPage.tsx*/

import { useRegister } from ""@refinedev/core"";

type RegisterVariables = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
};

export const RegisterPage = () => {
  const { mutate: register } = useRegister<RegisterVariables>();

  const onSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const values = {
        name: e.currentTarget.name.value,
      email: e.currentTarget.email.value,
      password: e.currentTarget.password.value,
    };
    console.log(values);
    register(values);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input name=""name"" value=""test"" />

      <input name=""password"" value=""refine"" />
      <button type=""submit"">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

### Expected behavior

in the console, the values passed to register() function are printed as {name: '...', email: '..', password:'...'}. But when you inspect in the network window using Google Chrome, auth/signup request payloads are something like {email: '...', password: '...'} omitting name on the fly.

We've created a branch to migrate our application code to RQ v5, but have refrained since Refine uses RQ under the hood and want to avoid breaking any dependencies.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Keep using RQ v4 for the time being.

### Additional context

https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/guides/migrating-to-v5

The migration process is relatively straightforward. They did remove the query callbacks, and the new paradigm for reacting to queries is doing so with `useEffect` hooks. One can still set global callbacks for queries, which refine uses for the notifications context, so the migration for Refine will likely center around that for their custom useQuery hooks.

They've also standardized the query function signatures only to accept objects. The typing should auto-alert the internal refine code.

2034552472,5357,[FEAT] Supabase LiveProvider improvements,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Using Supabase client's liveProvider, with `liveMode: ""auto""`...

1) On a page featuring a List, where the primary resource has related/child resources, liveProvider subscriptions that are automatically added to watch for changes on child/related resources overwrite other subscriptions on the page, so the only one that actually is left working is the last one to get set up. Naturally, this means the main resource (plus any other related/child resources on the page before this one), do not receive change notification messages. This is actually a bug, caused by every call to `subscribe` using the same channel name of `""any""`.

2) Calls to Supabase's liveProvider's `subscribe` method do not currently handle multiple event types — only the first in the passed `types` param gets used. This is mentioned in the 'Caution' section of https://refine.dev/docs/packages/data-providers/supabase/#supabase-real-time-support, where it says ""Multiple subscriptions needs to be made in a single call, which is not supported by the current version of the `@refinedev/supabase` data provider.""

### Describe the thing to improve

I have fixed both of the above-mentioned issues.

My changes consist of: 

- Building a proper channel name to send to Supabase, using the (a) `channel` passed in to the call to `subscribe` (which includes the resource name), plus (b) the passed event `types` (sorted, for stability), and additionally (c) a string based upon `params.filters`. This fixes (1) above. Therefore a channel name passed internally to Supabase with the new code might look like `""resources/blog_posts:*:` (assuming no filters here) — as opposed to all subscriptions on the page using `""any""` as their channel name.
- Calling `client.[...].on` for every event in `types` before calling `subscribe` — as opposed to the current code which only called `client.[...].on` once, using `events[0]`.

I've currently done all of this in a swizzled copy of the Supabase data provider, but I will put together a proper pull request, and reference this issue.",,

It doesn't take the `idColumnName` from meta in `Refine` component which I would assume it would be the correct way.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set up `Show` route for a resource that has a different primary key than `id`
2. Use `AntdShowInferencer`

### Expected behavior

I would expect that the ShowInferencer will take the `meta` property from the resources definition into account.

refinedev/supabase package is not returning the ID of the uploaded file. After checking the storage API's latest update, the ID is being returned after calling the ""upload"" API. However, in the refinedev/supabase npm package, storage.upload() function, only the path (string) and the fullPath (string) are returned. Kindly add the file id to the response since some users will link the file id to their database tables.

After going through the code in refindev/supabase npm package, I noticed that the ID is being returned by the storage API but the structure of the returned object was {""path"": string, ""fullPath"": string}. Kindly fix it to { id: string; path: string; fullPath: string }
note that the change should be done in StorageFileAPI.ts file line 201

Fixed it by manually changing the @supabase/supabase-js version to 2.39.0 in 'node_modules/@refinedev/supabase/package.json'

### Additional context

This is the current implementation of generating the sort parameter, https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/hasura/src/utils/generateSorting.ts#L10C1-L25.

Which should generate an array of `${operation}_order_by`, but currently generates a record of `${operation}_order_by`,
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/hasura/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L112-L116.

The generation of the sort parameter should be recursive like https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/master/packages/hasura/src/utils/generateFilters.ts#L111-L122.

```
[

    order: 'asc'
  },
  {
    field: 'rx_received_date',

Would produce an output like,

      ""name_and_dob"": ""asc""

  },
  {

  const { field, order } = sorter;

2006562411,5306,[FEAT] Provide resource information inside of the data-provider for composite primary keys,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

We're currently creating a workaround inside of our custom-data-provider to provide multi-key resource functionality. Say a URL not just has `:id` as a parameter, but you want to request a more specific resource for a `:locale_id` and `country_id`. In refine a resource for this would look like the following example:

```
...
{
  name: 'myi18nresource',
  identifier: 'myi18nresource',
  list: '/myi18n/',
  show: '/myi18n/show/:id/:locale_id/:country_id',
  edit: '/myi18n/edit/:id/:locale_id/:country_id',
},
...
```

Despite the fact that Refine does not provide composite-primary-key support we could come up with something like this inside our custom data-provider. 

```tsx
const isTranslationTable = resource.toLowerCase().includes('i18n');
if (isTranslationTable && metaHasLocale && metaHasCountry) {
  return `${url}/${id}/${meta.locale_id}/${meta.country_id}`;
}
```

I have three of this kind and I'm about to implement the fourth, whereas I'm just trying to see: 
""Is there a meta field with the same name in the route of my resource?""
""Yes? OK then set the param in the url to the meta-fields value!""

Right now we cannot access route-information from the actual resource inside of data-provider.getOne, which doesn't make sense to me.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

If we had access to the actual resource definition inside of i.e. `getOne`, we could do something like this:

```
const metaHasEditUrl = 'url' in meta;
if (metaHasEditUrl) {
  console.log({ meta });
  const metaUrl = meta.url as string;
  const urlPartsWithColons = metaUrl.split('/').filter((part) => part.includes(':'));

  const keysWithValues = urlPartsWithColons
    .map((part) => {
      const actualKey = part.replace(':', '');
      if (actualKey === 'id') return id;
      if (actualKey in meta) return meta[actualKey];
    })
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join('/');

  return `${url}/${keysWithValues}`;
}
```

As you can see I'm using `meta.url` which I added to the resource like this as a work-around:
```tsx
...
{
  name: 'myi18nresource',
  identifier: 'myi18nresource',
  list: '/myi18n/',
  show: '/myi18n/show/:id/:locale_id/:country_id',
  edit: '/myi18n/edit/:id/:locale_id/:country_id',
  meta: {
    url: '/myi18n/edit/:id/:locale_id/:country_id',
  },
},
...

Some people would like an OAuth provider only option, and no email/login password (some companies/websites actually only do OAuth providers, though I wouldn't say it's heavily common in the most popular apps). This makes it so we can use the providers in the AuthPage element, without actually making our own buttons.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

You'll either have to go into the source code itself and change it, or just make an entirely new couple of HTML elements.

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

I would like to see an attribute `providerOnly={true}`, or just something where we can directly access an attribute of an AuthPage element to remove the box/fields of Email/Password, or maybe at least customize it a bit, just like what we can do with the `loginLink` and `registerLink` and etc.
e.g.
```js
    <AuthPage
      type=""register""
      loginLink={
        <Box mb=""3"" bg=""gray.200"">
          <Link to=""/login"">Login</Link>
        </Box>
      }
    />

However, when I click on the Sidebar, the URL parameters disappear, but the actual filter values are not reset.

Encountered an issue in the Mantine Advance Filter Example Project in Refine.
When I click on a filter, the filter values are correctly applied to the URL parameters.

1978003326,5220,[BUG] Search form reset does not invalidate a table,"### Describe the bug

I want to add a `Reset` button for my filter form. But, in return, only the visuals of the form are getting cleared. If you try to trigger the refetch/submit manually, you will see that the request is sent with the previous values.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Get the example: https://refine.dev/docs/examples/table/antd/tableFilter/
2. Add the `<Button htmlType=""reset"" type=""default"" danger>Reset</Button>` button
3. See that on click only form is cleared, the result is not refetched


### Expected behavior

Clicking the reset button for the form filter triggers request invalidation as it is with the form filter submit button

1976851152,5216,[DOC] Some properties are not available in useHook (Headless mode),"### Documentation issue

While using headless mode, I ran into a rate limiting issue performing filters and pagination. I would like to handle this client side however the [documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/useTable/#resource) for properties seems out of date. Or I am not understanding its usage correctly. Please let me know!

### Describe the thing to improve

For example, to enable [client side filtering](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/useTable/#filtersmode) the docs say the following:
```
useTable({
    filters: {
        mode: ""off"",
    },
});
```

When it should be:

```
useTable({
    refineCoreProps: {
      filters: {
        mode: ""off"",
      },
    },
  });

Upgrading to the latest version of @ant-design/pro-layout in @refinedev/antd package.json should fix the issue.

1959029430,5159,[FEAT] AuthProvider as part of refine with integrations,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I looked into `AuthProvider` examples. All of them are exemplified into refine's `AuthProvider` interface usage.
I think it would be of great help to have it implemented as part of `refine` itself, similar to how `DataProvider` is within the repo.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

As an alternative solution, 
```js
import { useAuthProvider } from ""@refinedev/auth0"";

const authProvider = useAuthProvider({
      clientId: `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`,
      domain: `AUTH0_DOMAIN`,

Thanks for reaching out to us. It's understandable to be confused about this, as our documentation doesn't explain this topic well. The good news is that we'll be updating our documentation soon to cover this topic in more detail.

The issue generally arises because if the resource value used by `useTable` doesn't match the resource value of the `useDelete` hook, then the user has to manage the invalidation.

So, if the `useTable` hook is using the `""trial_participants""` value and the `useDelete` hook takes a different value like `""trial_participants_delete""` as its resource, you can update your state using one of the two methods found at https://refine.dev/docs/faq/#how-can-i-refetch-data."

In a relational data model, e.g., `countries` and `cities`, where a country can have multiple cities, I'd like to be able to use the `CreateButton` to create a city for a specific preselected country, i.e., pass the `countryId` to the city `Create` form so that the country can be preselected. Currently, I can only link to a blank form and need to manually select the country, even when it's known from the context.

  {

    create: '/countries/:countryId/create',
  },
```
in conjunction with the `meta` property of `CreateButton` and `useParsed()` in the create form, but that seems very hacky because I need to create an additional resource, duplicate the city create form, and it's not scalable to multiple values.

I also tried using query parameters for the resource, e.g.,
```js

I would very much like to avoid running anything on the host network. For starters, I'm not running pure Docker, it was more or less a simplification for the issue tracker. I'm running a minimal Kubernetes cluster (based on k3s/k3d), so host networking is way more difficult that just setting `--network=host` (besides, some team mates are running Windows with WSL2, which does not support host networking). Running Devtools and the app on the same network wouldn't normally do anything, since Devtools would still be listening only on `localhost`.

On the other point: my application (running with `vite`) is running with the `--host 0.0.0.0` option, so that I can reach it from outside the container. In general, the problem is similar: if I want to run my development in container, I cannot do so with pure `vite`, which would bind itself to `localhost` by default, I need to add that option to actually expose ports. Which is totally fine, `localhost` is a sane default, there just needs to be an override option.

The `docker-compose.yaml` (there is no Dockerfile) corresponding to my Kubernetes config would look something like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: ""node:18""
    volumes:
      - ""./:/app""
    working_dir: /app
    ports:
      - 5173:5173
    command: [""sh"", ""-c"", ""npm install && npm run dev -- --host""]
```

I would normally run the devtools in the same container by default, but I'm also open to starting a separate container. "

Hey!

I discovered this project and was eager to try out refine for the first time.

After running the npm run dev command I get this message:
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'firstChild')

I followed the setup guide from the documentation.
I tried googling for a solution and debugging it myself but could not find a proper solution and figured that it might be better to ask for help here.

1919055308,5035,[BUG] useCustomMutation is persisting the header,"### Describe the bug

If we pass an extra header in useCustomMutation for an API call using the config property. For all the subsequent calls, we are getting the same header in the API calls. 
For more info, please check this out: https://discord.com/channels/837692625737613362/1156918397905420288

### Steps To Reproduce

Pass on an extra header in useCustomMutation using the config property for an API call & hit the API.
Then, for some other API call, hit the API using useCustomMutation with no headers passed.
Now, in the other API call, the same header will be present which was passed in the previous API call. This will be happening for all the subsequent API calls until the page is refreshed.

### Expected behavior

The extra headers should be ONLY passed for the API call in which the headers are explicitly mentioned in the useCustomMutation hook. They shouldn't be passed for any further calls.

If `useQueryClient` is used to invalidate data on NextJS Layout this raise this error `Error: No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`.

I have already found a workaround that is to define a `QueryClientProvider` parent of Refine. I think the source of this bug is Layout have been rendered before the QueryClientProvider. But i'm not sure if that will create some side effects.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Define queryClient in _app.js with useState cache.
2. Extend MyApp with Layout. I use typescript.
```
type NextPageWithLayout<P = object | undefined, IP = P> = NextPage<
  P,
  IP
> & {
  noTemplate?: boolean
  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement, pageProps: AppProps) => ReactNode
}
type ExtendedAppProps = AppProps & {
  Component: NextPageWithLayout
}

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: ExtendedAppProps): JSX.Element {
  const [queryClient] = useState<QueryClient>(new QueryClient())

  const getLayout = useMemo(
    () => Component.getLayout ?? ((page: ReactElement) => page),
    [Component]
  )

  const ComponentWithLayout: React.FC<{
    children: JSX.Element
  }> = ({ children }): ReactNode => {
    return getLayout(children, pageProps)
  }

  return (
    <Refine
      options={{
        reactQuery: {
          clientConfig: queryClient,
        },
    }}
    ...>
          <ComponentWithLayout>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ComponentWithLayout>
</Refine>
```
3. Create some layout
```
const Layout: React.FC<{
  children: ReactElement
}> = ({ children }) => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()
  return (
    <div>{children}</div>
  )
}
```
4. Create page with layout
```
Page.getLayout = (page: ReactElement, pageProps: AppProps) => (
    <Layout>
      {page}
    </Layout>
)
5. Reload the page. The bug happen during the hard refresh.

I'm not a React pro at all and I'm going through your tutorial. And the section 2.4 about inferencer is not clear at all: https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/getting-started/antd/generate-crud-pages/

It is said that somehow when you add `AntdInferencer` to your `App.tsx` it should generate something. But nothing was actually generated (and who is responsible for that actually?)

Another problem is that the code in `npm create refine-app@latest -- -o refine-antd tutorial` is slightly different from what is in the tutorial. So it adds another layer of confusion

I would like to display Nhost users in an Antd table. Nhost predefines and uses camelCase i.e.,`usersAggregate` for the Select Aggregate on the users table. This is not compatible with the snake_case operation names found throughout Hasura and the dataProvider useList function

Hasura and Hasura Provider can use either ""hasura-default"" or ""graphql-default"" as the naming convention for GraphQL fields.
When using the latter, attempting to retrieve a list with filter `null` and `nnull` will result in a ""Error: field '_is_null' not found in type: ..."" and data retrieval will fail.

The mappings ""null"" and ""nnull"" are defined as ""_is_null"", but if naming-convention: graphql-default is specified, they must be converted to camelCase, i.e. ""_isNull"". 

refs: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/hasura/src/utils/generateFilters.ts#L40-L45

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a project with the following configuration values.

```
❯ npm create refine-app@latest
✔ Downloaded remote source successfully.
✔ Choose a project template · refine-vite
✔ What would you like to name your project?: · metal-goats-flash
✔ Choose your backend service to connect: · data-provider-hasura
✔ Do you want to use a UI Framework?: · mui
✔ Do you want to add example pages?: · no
✔ Do you need any Authentication logic?: · none
✔ Do you need i18n (Internationalization) support?: · no
✔ Choose a package manager: · npm

2. Add namingConvention settings to Hasura Provider(src/App.tsx).

```tsx
  <Refine
-    dataProvider={dataProvider(client)}
+    dataProvider={dataProvider(client, { namingConvention: ""graphql-default"" })} 
```

3. Create a Hasura project for testing and set naming-convention to graphql-default according to the [documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/naming-convention/).
4. Add an appropriate resource for the list and generate the list display page with inferencer.

1903895834,4970,[BUG] Some MUI Data Grid filter is not working with Hasura Provider,"### Describe the bug

When using MUI's DataGrid and Hasura Provider and selecting 'starts with', 'ends with' or 'is any of' in the DataGrid default filter, I get the 'Operator <SELECTED_OPERATOR_NAME> is not supported' error.

---

Here is my guess for the situation.

The error seems to occur because the Hasura Provider throws an exception when an unsupported filter is specified in the Hasura Provider.
However, the Hasura Provider defines 'starts with' and 'ends with' as filters. 

Therefore, I suspect that this is not a bug specific to Hasura Provider, but a bug in useDataGrid, which provides props to the Data Grid. useDataGrid has a process for converting MUI operators to refine CRUDOperators. However, the conversion target for the three filters above is not implemented here. 

refs: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/mui/src/definitions/dataGrid/index.ts#L35-L69

The 'equals', 'isEmpty' and 'isNotEmpty' definitions, which are defined here, and 'contains', which can be referenced directly in the Hasura Provider, work correctly.

The title of this issue assumes that the MUI and Hasura Providers are used, but in reality other DataProviders may not be able to retrieve data correctly, just because they do not generate errors.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create MUI × Hasura playground with [refine.dev](https://refine.dev/#playground). (I chose Vite + MUI + Hasura + No Auth)
1. Filter record by one of the operators ""starts with"", ""ends with"", ""is any of"".
1. After a while, an error ""Operator <SELECTED_OPERATOR_NAME> is not supported"" is  occurs.

### Expected behavior

- ""starts with"" behaves as a starts with filter for each Provider.
- ""ends with"" behaves as an ends with filter for each Provider.
- ""is any of"" shall behave as an in filter for each Provider.

### Additional Context

There is also a bug that the ""is not empty"" filter does not work correctly if ""namingConvention: ""graphql-default"" is specified in the Hasura provider.

### Steps To Reproduce

Run `pnpm create refine-app@latest`, selecting:

- Vite
- Hasura
- Mantine or Chakra (I haven't tested other options)
- Yes (for example page)
- Custom (for auth provider)
- Yes or No (for i18n support, I've tested both)
- pNpm (npm works correctly)

Then `cd` into the new directory and run `pnpm dev`

### Expected behavior

The app should start correctly.

1880517843,4908,[DOC] Adding Instructions for using Keycloak JWT with DataProvider/Axios in Refine,"### Documentation issue

No, this is not related to an existing part of the documentation.

### Describe the thing to improve

A clear and concise description of problems and what you would like to see.
I would like to suggest adding a section to the documentation or examples that demonstrates how to use Keycloak JWT with the DataProvider and Axios in Refine. Specifically, I'd like to see guidance on how to pass headers to the AxiosInstance, such as 
```JS
request.headers[""Authorization""] = Bearer ${token}`; 
```
in the context of authentication with Keycloak.

Example:
```JS
axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use((request) => {

  // const { key, init } = useKeycloak();
  const token = localStorage.getItem(TOKEN_KEY);
  if (token) {
    if (request.headers) {
      request.headers[""Authorization""] = `Bearer ${token}`;
      request.headers[""Accept""] = `application/vnd.api+json`;
      request.headers[""Content-Type""] = `application/vnd.api+json`;
    }
  }
  return request;
});
```

### Describe the solution (optional)

To improve the experience for beginners and readers, I propose adding a dedicated section or example in the documentation that showcases the integration of Keycloak JWT with Refine's DataProvider and Axios. This section should provide step-by-step instructions, code samples, and explanations on how to set up authentication using Keycloak and pass authentication headers in Axios requests. ",,

I wanted to add a custom optionLabel in useSelect hook which I couldn't manipulate in useSelect options, @omeraplak have helped me with creating a custom options which resolved my issues as below:
```

const allOptions = [

https://example.admin.refine.dev/orders?pageSize=10&current=1&filters[0][field]=user.id&filters[0][operator]=eq&filters[0][value]=1

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Apply a select filter on a web page with refine and Antd
2. Reload page (f5) or copy to another tab/browser
3. The binding of the query filter is done incorrectly by setting the option to value instead of the text in the filter.
You will see ""1"" in the select instead of ""Walter Ridge"".

The same text should be displayed in the select when filtering for the first time, if the page is reloaded, opened in another tab or the url is shared.

Using below code to handle a form submission. After successful submission, the form query make a refetche even though **invalidates: false** is set (same behaviour is seen with invalidates: [""list""] and any other value)

We are using a custom GraphQL live provider using Apollo client.

Every mutation return the created/updated object it our application, so we want this to update the query data directly and skip this unwanted refetch.

1. Add a form using useForm hook:

```
const formProps = useForm<ICompany>({
        refineCoreProps: {

in the doucmentation it is stated 
Sider is integrated, which means that unaccessible resources won't appear in the sider menu. 

but it does unless i manually hide it through meta:{hide} property


### Steps To Reproduce

i have this basic AccessControlProvider

```
export const accessControlProvider : AccessControlProvider= {
    can: async ({ resource, action, params }) => {
        const roles = (await authProvider.getPermissions?.() as string[])||[];

        if (resource === ""User"") {
            return {
                can: roles.includes('admin'),

        },
    },

}
```


### Expected behavior

this should effectively hide Users from sider menu when role is not admin. since can is false when the action is list (in fact in my code its always false for non admin users) 

when i go to users route (click on the menu item) it correctly says unauthorized so the provider is working correctly but it just wont hide User from sider.

 - I get this either on the **[official hosted](https://example.mui.admin.refine.dev/)** version or a **local instance**
 - When interacting with the demo, **everything feels very sluggish**
 - For instance, on the `orders` page, when interacting with the `status` filter, there is a noticable several 100ms delay when first clicking the dropdown and also when selecting a value, whilst the filter itself is not live (you have to press the ""FILTER"" CTA to apply it)
 - I run latest Chrome on a powerful PC (no other app/website feels slow) so I don't think my machine is to blame
 - In fact, [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-example-mui-admin-refine-dev-orders/8kerm4esjx?form_factor=mobile) confirms similar poor performance on the login page alone

So naturally my 2 questions are:  

**Why such performance issues? What can be done to address that?**",,
1857954338,4841,[BUG] I face an error with infrancer ,"### Describe the bug


This what I face when I try to load the data

I use the REST api way, and the data is persisted but the error appears after that

The API isn't complete yet and does not have the pagination yet

I removed the pagination and all sorter and stuff but still get the error and the url change to have the searchParams

### Steps To Reproduce

just I go to the page

and also the auto direct to the page isn't working too

it returns empty page 

### Expected behavior

the error should not persiste

1857766745,4840,[BUG] `deleteOne` from `mutateDelete` Function Not Invoked Correctly in List View When Using Specific Resource Name,"### Describe the bug

When attempting to delete a specific resource using the `mutateDelete `function in refine, the associated `deleteOne `function is not being called with the correct resource name. However, when passing random gibberish into the resource name for `mutateDelete`, it does invoke the `deleteOne `function, indicating unexpected behavior.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set up a list view with column actions allowing deletion of a specific row.
2. Configure the `deleteOne `function in the `dataProvider` (custom dataProvider).
3. Attempt to delete a row using the delete action and observe that the `deleteOne `function is not called (also observer errors in console)
4. Pass random gibberish as the resource name in `mutateDelete `and observe that the `deleteOne `function is called.

### Expected behavior

The `deleteOne` function should be called with the correct resource name when attempting to delete a specific row.

### Screenshot

The `deleteOne `function is not called with the correct resource name, but instead appears to be invoked when passing random gibberish as the resource name.

### Desktop

- Windows 11
- Chrome
- Version 115.0.5790.171 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- used custom dataProvider (pretty standard stuff from the docs, just really added axios interceptors to add custom auth headers on all requests, this works fine)
- used custom authProvider (made it to work with AWS Amplify Auth library so I can use AWS Cognito for auth)

1856328316,4839,[BUG]. Loss of TranslationContext after wrapping a three-way package ,"### Describe the bug

Wrapped a third-party library, using @refinedev/core and react-i18next, after installing this third-party library in the project, using useGetLocale, useTranslate and other language package hooks, all failed, but directly using the react-i18next hook, everything is fine!

```
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'
const { t, i18n } = useTranslation()
```

If you apply another hook to the methods such as useGetLocale in the triple library, it works fine, as follows:
```
import {
  I18nProvider, useTranslate as useRTranslation()
  useTranslate as useRTranslate, useGetLocale as useRGTranslate, useGetLocale as useRGTranslate
  
  useSetLocale as useRSetLocale, } from '@refinedev/core'
} from '@refinedev/core'

export const useTranslate = () => {
  return useRTranslate()
}


export const useGetLocale = () => {
  return useRGetLocale()
}

export const useSetLocale = () => { return useRSetLocale() }
  return useRSetLocale()
}
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a tripartite library that uses and uses react-i18next and @refinedev/core

```
import enTranslation from '.. /locales/en/common.json'
import zhTranslation from '.. /locales/zh/common.json'

i18n
.use(detector)
.use(initReactI18next)
.init({
supportedLngs: ['en', 'zh'],
resources: {
en: {
common: enTranslation,
},
zh: {
common: zhTranslation,
},
},
ns: ['common'],
defaultNS: 'common',
fallbackLng: ['en', 'zh'],
interpolation: {
escapeValue: false, // not needed for react as it escapes by default
},
})

export default i18n
```

```

const { i18n, t } = useTranslation()
const  i18nProvider = {
translate: (key: string, params: object) => t(key, params),
changeLocale: (lang: string) => i18n.changeLanguage(lang),
getLocale: () => i18n.language,
}
const App = (props) => {

return <Refine
  i18nProvider={i18nProvider}
  >
  <Outlet />
  </Refine>
  }
```

2. Install the three-party library in the project

```
import i18n from ""./i18n""

<React.StrictMode>
<React.Suspense fallback='loading'>
<I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
<App><MyComp /></App>
</I18nextProvider>
</React.Suspense>
</React.StrictMode>
```

3, used in MyComp, return empty

```
import { useTranslate, useGetLocale, TranslationContext } from '@refinedev/core'

const translationContext = useContext(TranslationContext)
const locale = useGetLocale()
console.log(locale(), translationContext)
```

### Expected behavior

Methods such as useGetLocale should be passed correctly in the above text, just like the useTranslation method.

1846691007,4816,[BUG] @refine/mui list header buttons do not align,"### Describe the bug

When using the `<List>` component with header buttons (like the create button) the buttons horizontal align is inconsistent with the rest of the layout.

The code used is pretty standard:
```jsx
<List>
  <DataGrid
    {...dataGridProps}
    columns={columns}
    disableColumnMenu
    autoHeight
  />
</List>
```

See screenshot attached for the result.


### Steps To Reproduce

I prepared a codesandbox with a very basic example, just navigate to this URL:

https://codesandbox.io/s/refinedev-with-mui-hw2z4d?file=/src/PostList.tsx:540-685

It's a very minimal setup with @refinedev/mui and it's clear that the *Create* button is not aligned in the `PostList` component.

### Expected behavior

The header buttons should have some margin right. If I add that margin manually then everything's ok:

```jsx
<List headerButtons={({ defaultButtons }) => (
  <Stack direction=""row"" gap={2} mr={1}>
    {defaultButtons}

`205: +    onGlobalFilterChange: setGlobalFilter,`
`326: +    <label htmlFor=""globalFilter"">Global filter: </label>`

`330: +           value={(globalFilter as string) ?? """"}`
`331: +           onChange={(event) => setGlobalFilter(event.target.value)}`

2. i used setGlobalFilter from useTable:

file structure
```
...
apps
-- client (next app)
-- admin (refine app using vite)
...
package.json (shared between apps and contains both next and vite)
```

Yes, it is related to a problem. I am migrating a refine app built with Vite into an Nx monorepo that has a single shared package.json in the root. The Nx monorepo also contains a Next.js app.

It seems like when I run the `refine dev` command, the cli attempts to start the app as a next.js app rather than a vite app.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I am thinking I will have to switch to using the nextjs platform to run refine on, rather than using vite (which I'd prefer and already have set up).

### Additional context

The problem seems to be coming from the `getProjectType` util in the cli package.

this is a snippet of code from line 26:

```
    // check for next
    if (dependencies.includes(""next"") || devDependencies.includes(""next"")) {
        return ProjectTypes.NEXTJS;
    }

    // check for remix
    if (
        dependencies.includes(""@remix-run/react"") ||
        devDependencies.includes(""@remix-run/react"")
    ) {
        return ProjectTypes.REMIX;
    }

    // check for vite
    if (dependencies.includes(""vite"") || devDependencies.includes(""vite"")) {
        return ProjectTypes.VITE;
    }
```

I believe that due to next being listed as a dependency within the large, shared package.json of the monorepo, the `getProjectType` util returns that the refine app requires the Next.js config rather than the Vite config.

### Describe the thing to improve

I would like to be able to pass in a flag that specifies the proper config to build/dev correctly.

1838306299,4793,[BUG] Meta title reverts to 'refine' when page isn't loaded.,"### Describe the bug

My pages use a layout's custom headers such as:
```
  <Head>
    <title>My page title</title>
    <meta property=""og:title"" content=""My page title"" key=""title"" />
  </Head>
```
When i load one of these pages the Title of the page (as shown by metatag) shows as 'refine' (hover over the browser tab to see) then it flash-changes to 'My page title' (which is what i want). If i navigate away from this page and navigate back the Title now only shows as 'refine' and not 'My page title'.

1. how to avoid the default 'refine' page title showing up? (the flash of titles is annoying on my end)
2. how to have my page titles never revert to 'refine' as the default (and my metatag are ignored)?

Am using Next 13+ and Chakra UI.

Thanks!

### Steps To Reproduce

1. add <Head> element to a Next page
2. load page, see title not be as desired.

### Expected behavior

There should be a simple way to overwrite the 'refine' title so that it never shows at all.

1835961921,4782,[BUG] Redirection after login does not work if async code is used in authProvider check method,"### Describe the bug

When the user logs in, they are redirected to the first resource defined on the refined resources instead of the custom redirect path specified in the login method. This is caused because I am making an API call to verify if the JWT is valid within the check method, which is automatically executed after login. If I remove this call, the redirection occurs as expected. However, I really need to redirect the user based on the API response, as their landing page after a successful login depends on it. Despite trying with async/await and promises callback, I have been unable to solve this problem. For now, I will verify that the token exists in localStorage, but I prefer to avoid this for security reasons.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. use the cli to install refine with authProvider
2. set redirectTo  property on the login method
3. await for a promise within the check method
4. try to login

### Expected behavior

User should be redirected to the custom path specified if it is successfully login

1804956885,4668,[FEAT] allow custom params to be passed on the accessControl property on refine buttons ,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I´m using cerbos.dev as access control provider. On Cerbos, we can set conditions to allow or deny access to a certain resources. The fields for these conditions must be passed on the attr key, which, on refine, is set on the attributes key. If the condition is not met, data is denied. 

So, I have a situation where the user should have access to the content inside a ShowButton but it wont because the attributes are not being passed when access control is applied, so cerbos, by default, denies access because it does not have enough data to allow the request.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Right now, I can only set these attributes if wrap the button on a CanAccess component, like this:

```
<CanAccess
    resource=""procedures""
    action=""show""
    params={{
        id: record.id,
        user_access_control: record.user_access_control,
    }}

        type=""primary""
        size=""small""
        recordItemId={record.id}
        accessControl={{ enabled: false }}
    />
</CanAccess> 
```  

On the component, user_access_control is a json with information regarding allowed users ids, allowed departaments etc.


### Additional context

Params is hardcoded on the show button, here is part of the showButton component, as example:

```
#refine/packages/antd/src/components/buttons/show/index.tsx
const { data } = useCan({
        resource: resource?.name,

        queryOptions: {
            enabled: accessControlEnabled,
        },
    });

```
So, maybe, we can just add the possibility to pass params to accessControlContext

I think we could be able to do something like this:

It would be great if you allow to pass down a prop ""fixed"" to the Sidebar that can then influences the behaviour of the renderMenu function within the Side component from ""@refinedev/antd"";

### Additional context

_No response_

### Describe the thing to improve

I can not add a fixed property to the menu items so that they will be fixed on the left hand side. I would like to be able to pass either a property down ""fixed"" to the sider with the following options and consequences:
fixed={true}
--> Menu items are fixed on the left hand side
--> I have a flow scroll on the left hand side, in case menu items are in number higher than the screen can fit in

1803198749,4666,[DOC] Broken hover effect in the deprecated light mode.,"### Documentation issue

While hovering the deprecated items in the table, the hover effect makes the tool tip unreadable. Because it is transparent.

I have verified the issue by opening the documentation in incognito mode. And it exists there also.

### Describe the thing to improve

The css variable that is used to switch the background of the tool tip during the theme change, changes the variable value to `#1b1b1d` in dark mode and changes to `#0000` in light mode, which means instead of giving a white color it is giving a completely black color with 0 as it's alpha value. So it is a transparent color Hence the problem is caused. 

### Describe the solution (optional)

While changing to light mode it should contain a white color.",,

### Additional Context

I did a bit of digging and the problem looks like it starts in rc-util/es/DOM/dynamicCSS.js (antd dependency) in the getContainer(options) function, where there may be a race condition. If you log out options and document, both are defined, but document.body and document.querySelector('head') are both undefined. 

`function getContainer(option) {
  console.log('getContainer option', option)
  if (option.attachTo) {
    return option.attachTo;
  }
  var head = document.querySelector('head');
  console.log('getContainer head', head)
  console.log('getContainer document.body', document.body)
  console.log('document', document)
  return head || document.body;
}`

double returns:

I can also bring this up to antd's issue board, if this is better suited there, but I'm hoping this is a matter of getting something to load inside a useEffect. 


P.S.
There looks like there's a known issue with rc-util and antd ([see here](https://github.com/react-component/util/pull/114)) that had been resolved with a versions of rc-util from 2020. It's very similar issue, but dealt with a getContainer function that was returning null somewhere else. I did a quick double check, and everything is running on latest right now (antd@5.6.4 and rc-util@5.34.1). There was also an [antd issue](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/169) on it like 8 years ago, but the solution didn't seem to help. ",,
1795499482,4649,[FEAT] Toggle off automatic real-time message publishing with Refine hooks on the client side,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Just a suggestion, there should be a way to shut off automatically publishing a message with hooks when using the live provider. 

`<Refine

Right now, useUpdate and many other supported hooks will automatically publish a message when triggered. Developers sometimes only publish messages on the server side and keep the client to only receiving those messages.

Also added `filters={...}` and `onFilter{...}` to the status `<Table.Column />`. The filter works, you can select for example ""Draft"" and it will show only the draft posts, but the pages doesn't contain the X/page rows, the amount of rows is  the draft posts that were originally on each page.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to [codesanbox example](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/gifted-rui-8hygc6?embed=1&file=%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2Fposts%2Flist.tsx%3A70%2C13-70%2C26)

1769029254,4574,[BUG] List retrieval fails when using Hasura Provider with naming-convention: graphql-default,"### Describe the bug

Hasura and Hasura Provider can use either ""hasura-default"" or ""graphql-default"" as the naming convention for GraphQL fields.
When using the latter, attempting to retrieve a list will result in a ""TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'aggregate')"" and data retrieval will fail.

In getList, the total number of data is obtained by `result[aggregateOperation].aggregate.count`, but when using graphql-default, a camelized aggregateOperation is returned in the query when graphql-default is used.
In fact, when I modified the corresponding part of the Hasura Provider through swizzle to `camelizedAggregateOperation`, the data collection worked fine.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a project with the following configuration values.

```bash
❯ npm create refine-app@latest
✔ Downloaded remote source successfully.
✔ Choose a project template · refine-vite
✔ What would you like to name your project?: · metal-goats-flash
✔ Choose your backend service to connect: · data-provider-hasura
✔ Do you want to use a UI Framework?: · mui
✔ Do you want to add example pages?: · no
✔ Do you need any Authentication logic?: · none
✔ Do you need i18n (Internationalization) support?: · no
✔ Choose a package manager: · npm
```

2. Add namingConvention settings to Hasura Provider(src/App.tsx).

```diff
  <Refine
-    dataProvider={dataProvider(client)}
+    dataProvider={dataProvider(client, { namingConvention: ""graphql-default"" })} 
```

3. Create a Hasura project for testing and set naming-convention to graphql-default according to the [documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/naming-convention/).
4. Add an appropriate resource for the list and generate the list display page with inferencer.
5. The above-mentioned bug occurs during data acquisition.

### Expected behavior

Correct list acquisition even if naming-convention is graphql-default.

1767513282,4567,[FEAT] Customization of RefineKbar,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently it's possible to have resources with the same name but different identifiers. We are using this to differentiate between different databases, that have the same kind of model inside (i.e. Country). The problem here is that we cannot differentiate between the resources, since the `dataProvider` or `dataProviderName` is not taken into concern.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

* We could go ahead and rewrite the RefineKbar provider ourselves, but that'd just lead to a separating solution where nobody benefits ultimately
* We could also just rewrite a similar provider, but then we'd face issues when it comes down to access control

The problem is that RefineKbar is not customizable. Customizing a component inside of a framework to your needs is ultimately what Refine should be able to do for its users.

Currently, i18n is trying to fetch translation.json file in the relative language directory before falling back to the defaultNs.
Can be seen below
<img width=""246"" alt=""refine-lang-error"" src=""https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/78694073/09851d1f-6c30-488d-8901-d1a2c2bb0257"">

Another problem that I noticed is that in the docs we only installed 2 packages but missed out on installing **i18next-http-backend** and  **i18next-browser-languagedetector** packages which are then later immediately imported in the next section where we creating the i18n instance:

![image](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/assets/78694073/c1f7f110-4d43-4c71-9118-28333dd2021b)


### Describe the thing to improve

1. For the first issue, Just add the **ns** property and set it to be an array of common namespace that is being used in the
**defaultNs**
2. For the second one, we can just import all the required packages, instead of installing them separately since they are being imported immediately in the next session when creating the i18n instance.

### Describe the solution (optional)

**1.** Just by setting **ns** option to be an array of the namespace that is used in the defaultNs fixes it.  
This is because by default ns is set to [translation](https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options) and it still tries to fetch it before it uses the **defaultNs**

```diff
 i18n.use(Backend) 
     .use(detector) 
     .use(initReactI18next) 
     .init({ 
         supportedLngs: [""en"", ""de""], 
         backend: { 
             loadPath: ""/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json"", 
         }, 
+       ns: [""common""],
         defaultNS: ""common"", 
         fallbackLng: [""en"", ""de""], 
     }); 

```

**2.** For the second issue we can just install the two packages togather:
```diff
- npm install react-i18next i18next
+ npm install react-i18next i18next i18next-http-backend i18next-browser-languagedetector

1760315848,4541,[FEAT] Prefetching hook that fetches server state data ( maybe based on action + resource),"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I think currently refine doesnt have a prefetch hook for a resource. Like if a user is hovering on a link/button or wherever the entity maybe, the developer might want to trigger prefetching based on it, however currently we dont have such hook to do so.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

The goal of prefetching is to make data fetch before the user navigates to a page or attempts to load some known content.  This will improve the user experience on page navigations as it will greatly cut down on the loading time due to the data being quickly available and we wont have to see the skeleton/loaders on our screen.

### Describe the thing to improve

I think a simple usePrefetch hook will be great where we can pass it action and resource.",,
1760293716,4540,[FEAT] Option for a toast message with CanAccess/CatchAllNavigate component ,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently with **CanAccess** component, I am unable to show a toast message. This is how I am calling it, where the fallback is a navigation component.
```tsx
<CanAccess fallback={<CatchAllNavigate to=""/"" />} >
```

### Describe alternatives you've considered

One way to hack it is by wrapping my fallback inside a component which will just fire a toast (either that or I can just customise my fallback to handle the toast).

### Additional context

At present, **CanAccess** works but there is no visual feedback unless I chose to make the fallback be a component that lays out the reason. Lets say the user tries to access a page that he doesn't have access to directly through the URL. Now the **CanAccess** component will run and redirect him back to whatever the fallback component is, but there would be no visual feedback if **used along side a navigation component** (like in my case). At least the way that I am using it which is with navigation back to my home page, upon redirection there is no visual feedback as to why the user wasnt able to access that page. Adding an option to show toast upon redirection will be helpful. 

### Describe the thing to improve

Maybe we can have an optional prop to show a toast. 

For example in the case of **CanAccess** we can have optional props like **showToast** and **toastMessage**. If the showToast is **true** and no **toastMessage** is passed the CanAccess component can just get the reason that we defined in the accessProvider. As noticed that **reason** is an optional **CanReturnType** so maybe we can just have **default message** that runs if the **showToast is true** **however**, both the reason in accessProvider and, toastMessage as a prop is not provided, then in this case the default message will be shown in the toast.

We can also choose to employ the same logic inside the **CatchAllNavigate** component (excluding the reason as this is a routing mechanism).

In previous versions, if the Table of Contents was empty on an article page, it would be centered.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I think that it would be visually more pleasing and comfortable if article pages were centered when the table of contents is disabled or not present.

### Additional context

I'm glad you like the layout of the article page, and I can definitely help you with centering it automatically. There are several ways to achieve this, depending on the structure of your webpage and the CSS styles that you're using.

One easy way is to set the `margin` property of the container element to `auto`. This will center the element horizontally within its parent container. Here's an example CSS rule that you could add to your stylesheet:

```css
.article-container {
  margin: auto;
}
```

In this example, `.article-container` is the class name of the container element that wraps around your article content. You can replace this with the actual class or ID name of your container element.

If you need further assistance with implementing this change, please let me know!

1747835566,4479,[BUG] `useExport` doesn't consume `resource` argument,"### Describe the bug

When using the `useExport` hook the `resource` parameter is not taken into consideration and the default resource name in page is always used.

----
Example: 

`list.tsx page`
```typescript
const { triggerExport } = useExport({
    resource: 'events_data',
    dataProviderName: 'rest',
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log(error);
    },
  });
```

`menu item`
```
    {
      name: 'data_process_logs',
      icon: <Icons.UnorderedListOutlined />,
      list: { component: LogsListPage, path: '/data/logs' },
      meta: {
        label: 'LOG',
      },
    },
```

The generated URL for exporting is always
`http://localhost:5001/data_process_logs?_end=20&_order=desc&_sort=timestamp&_start=0&` no matter what `resource` arg is passed to `useExport`

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a page with name `foo`
2. Import the useExport hook
3. Use another `resource` name for the export action, ex. `bar`
4. The generated url contains always `foo`

### Expected behavior

`useExport` hook should take into consideration `resource` arg passed when using it.

```typescript
const { triggerExport } = useExport({
    resource: 'events_data',
    dataProviderName: 'rest',
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log(error);
    },
  });
```

Should generate an url like:
`http://localhost:5001/events_data?_end=20&_order=desc&_sort=timestamp&_start=0&`

      goBack={<BackButton />}

As you can see in the above code that I have given prop **goBack** but it is not working as expected. It is not showing me the back /previous icon with link. It just shows title and no button prior to it which should not be like this.

**Note:** The URL for this page is **""/crfqs/comparison-analysis/97d0aab2""**. It is not having **show** keyword, I even tried with changed URL as well.
But when I use it on this URL ""/crfqs/show/97d0aab2"", it shows back button.


Kindly look into this issue and get it fixed as soon as possible.

### Steps To Reproduce

No steps.

### Expected behavior

It should show BACK button with **goBack** prop.

1735715524,4432,[DOC] Antd > Components > Buttons > Create is out-of-date,"### Documentation issue

While I was searching through abilities to change the `create`-Button on CRUD pages, I found out that the following page is out-of-date: https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/antd/components/buttons/create-button/

The documentation references a `headerButtons` on the `Table` component of `antd`, which does not exist (anymore).

### Describe the thing to improve

To pass props to the `create`-Button one has to adjust the `createButtonProps` on top of the `List` component that is being imported from `refinedev/antd`. You can probably use the `headerButtons` prop to pass in other button-components but that's something I will probably not need (but might be useful in the docs).

## System Info

- [ ] All required packages are up to date.
- [ ] Core and AntD libraries are being used.

### Last week, I migrated from version 3 to version 4.

I encountered a bug related to how ids are handled in your library. Due to the way ids are handled, I had to refactor my usage of the `useModalForm` hook.

Here's the original code:
```tsx
/*
* @description In the following example, only:
* https://localhost:5507/api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations/180b5f6b-0411-46f1-a217-bf4e93bdb99e
* will be fetched, and https://localhost:5507/api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations won't ever be called 
*/
const {
    queryResult: orgQueryResult,
    modalProps: updateOrgModalProps,
    formProps: updateOrgFormProps,
    show: showUpdateOrgModal,
    close: closeUpdateOrgModal
} = useModalForm<Organization, HttpError, IOrganizationFormValues>({
    action: 'edit',
    // Notice that 'id' is missing, but it's a part of the resource (query fetched exactly once)
    resource: `directory/Internal/v1/Organizations/${record?.organizationId as string}`,
    redirect: false,
    queryOptions: {
        enabled: Boolean(record?.organizationId)
    },
    onMutationSuccess: () => {
        closeUpdateOrgModal()
    }
})
```

Here's what I'm being forced to refactor with the new version:

```tsx
/*
* @description In the following example, both:
* https://localhost:5507/api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations/180b5f6b-0411-46f1-a217-bf4e93bdb99e
* will be fetched, and https://localhost:5507/api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations will also be called.
* The latter could potentially be a query with thousands of records (resulting in a significant performance hit).
*/
const orgId = record?.organizationId || undefined;
const {
    queryResult: orgQueryResult,
    modalProps: updateOrgModalProps,
    formProps: updateOrgFormProps,
    show: showUpdateOrgModal,
    close: closeUpdateOrgModal
} = useModalForm<Organization, HttpError, IOrganizationFormValues>({
    action: 'edit',
    id: orgId, // Notice that now I pass the 'id' as a prop
    resource: `directory/Internal/v1/Organizations`,
    redirect: false,
    syncWithLocation: false,
    queryOptions: {
        enabled: Boolean(orgId)
    },
    onMutationSuccess: () => {
        closeUpdateOrgModal()
    }
})
console.log('orgId:', orgId);
console.log('orgId enabled:', Boolean(orgId));
console.log('orgId orgQueryResult:', orgQueryResult?.data?.data);
```

### Why does this happen?

I am quite certain that this issue occurs because you set the id to an empty string. When the id is empty, the underlying hook used for fetching assumes that it is acceptable to fetch the resource and sends a query to the wrong path. However, once the id is received, the hook realizes it needs to re-render and re-fetch the correct data. In the end, the data turns out to be correct, and the form works as expected.

Unfortunately, there is no way to disable the initial query that is made for an endpoint with a similar name but is not the desired query. Here's an example of what should and should not be triggered:

Desired Query:
- `api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations/{someId}`

Undesired Query (should not be triggered if id is undefined):
- `api/directory/Internal/v1/Organizations`

### Steps To Reproduce

- [ ] create a useModalForm that depends on an id from other query
- [ ] make sure there are routes for `/posts` and `/posts/{id}`(must be same)
- [ ] observe both /posts and /posts/{id} is called when id is undefined 

### Expected behavior

 - [ ] The query is not enabled when Id is missing

### Screenshot

In a Next 13 with app directory, we can't go back from a Create page using the Create component to a List page using the List component.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a refine context in a client component, imports the next app router from `@refinedev/nextjs-router/app`, then provide the client component in the root layout.

2. Create a list and create pages

```ts

            test 1
        </List>
    )
}
```

        </Create>
    )
}
```

3. Go to the list page and click on the Create button
4. On the Create page, click on the return button
5. The URL will change but not the page content. The page will be stuck.

1729312807,4408,[BUG] the 'queryOptions.enabled' option of useSelect does not work as intende,"### Describe the bug

According to the [document](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/useSelect/#defaultvaluequeryoptions), queryOptions will be used when defaultValueQueryOptions is not passed in, but everything does not execute as expected when there is a defaultValue

### Steps To Reproduce

```javascript
useSelect({
  resource: ""todos"",
  defaultValue: 1,
  queryOptions: {
    enabled: false,
  },
});
```

### Expected behavior

Due to the 'enabled' being set to false, as expected, no requests should be made until it becomes true.

1724889337,4390,[BUG] Inferencer assumes `id` is number,"### Describe the bug

At least for the AntD Inferencers, the `id` is interpolated directly into the id property, seemingly assuming that it is a number:
```tsx
export const ${COMPONENT_NAME}: React.FC<IResourceComponentsProps> = () => {
        const { queryResult } = useShow(${
            isCustomPage
                ? `{ 
                    resource: ""${resource.name}"", 
                    id: ${id}, // <----- HERE
                    ${getMetaProps(
                        resource?.identifier ?? resource?.name,
                        meta,
                        ""getOne"",
                    )}
                }`
```

If one is using UUIDs or any other string-based ids, the Inferencer fails as the string is not properly assigned:

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Setup a test page with an inferencer.
2. Pass a string as an `id` with either `show` or `edit` actions.
3. Navigate to page and see error.

### Expected behavior

Component is able to fetch the data and render the component fully.

1721861252,4378,"[BUG] - setFilters with filters.mode=""off"" not updating the table ","### Describe the bug

when using external search box to filter a table with filter.mode set to ""off"" the filter query is correctly displayed on the location bar but the table will not be updated until the page is refreshed. i forked the basic example of react-table with charka-ui and able to reproduce the issue. 

### Steps To Reproduce

open https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/solitary-architecture-fne4uq?file=%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2Fposts%2Flist.tsx%3A140%2C21 
on the text filed ""search by title"" type any of the title eg. rter 
the table is not filtered.  even though the query string on location bar is set correctly

but if filters.mode is set to server or cleared the table will be filtered as expected. 


### Expected behavior

the table should be updated when user types text on the search field without requesting the server if  filter.mode is set to ""off"".
(only works after refreshing the page)

1719432004,4368,[BUG] Right clicking on the Refine logo opens up Figma design file for Refine logo,"### Describe the bug

When I right-click on the Refine logo on the homepage, a Figma design file for the logo opens up in a new tab. 
Link of Figma design file - https://www.figma.com/file/y8lhTyumAN0zYI5nKKLoLN/refine.dev-brand-assets?type=design&t=4Y56MTBK1eIlf1Oq-0on

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to Logo on Homepage ( this behavior persists on other pages as well )
2. Right-Click on the logo

### Expected behavior

Not sure, but
1 For starters stop opening the Figma design altogether (-  if this wasn't intentional to begin with)
2. Right-click should show normal browser options like - Save link, Open in a new tab or window, copy link, etc.

1718935739,4364,"[BUG] In ArchLinux, While creating app with refine doesn't initialize the git repository.","### Describe the bug

> **Note**
Only happening for ArchLinux

I wanted to create a next.js project using refine with app directory.
But I noticed one thing that it doesn't initialize the git repository.
Then I created applicaion with different flags but none of them were initializing git repo.


### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a project with any example
2. You'll probably see the error

### Expected behavior

Should create the project with git repo initialized.

Doesn't create the repo
But it does in Windows.
If there is something wrong with my side do let me know

1717273025,4361,[DOC] Live Provider for GraphQL,"### Documentation issue

https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/

### Describe the thing to improve

I'm new to refine, and I did already figure out how to use the Data Provider for GraphQL. But there's not much information for the Live Provider (Or I don't understand it!).
Do I need to create one by myself? Can I use the one in ""@refinedev/graphql""? How do I configure the Subscriptions?

1713634327,4346,[BUG] Blog footer darkmode text,"### Describe the bug

When in dark mode, the footer text is of dark color. That is, the text color is according to light mode even in dark mode. There should be a contrast between the background and the text, which is absent in this case, when in dark mode blog website, footer location

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Got to the Website (https://refine.dev/blog/)
2. Click on the dark mode button and activate it
3. Scroll down to see the footer
4. See an error; you will have difficulty in reading the text as it's not according to the dark mode

### Expected behavior

I expect the text color to be white in color when in dark mode. So the users can easily read it and there should be a contrast between the background and the text color

1702192331,4310,[FEAT]: Provide a way to tweak navigation for resources,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

It would be good if we can forcefully render on Resource click. For example, I'm working on a big-scale ERP-like software and I've created some resources like the following.

```javascript
//...some jsx stuff
resources={[
  {
    name: 'dashboard',
    list: '/',
    meta: {
      label: 'Dashboard',
      icon: <Dashboard />
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'weight-calculator',
    list: WEIGHT_CALCULATOR_PATH,
    meta: {
      label: 'Weight Calculator',
      parent: 'Tools',
      icon: <Calculate />
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'weight-calculator-records',
    list: WEIGHT_CALCULATOR_RECORDS_PATH,
    meta: {
      label: 'Calculation Records',
      parent: 'Tools',
      icon: <Feed />
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'roles-list',
    list: ROLES_LIST_PATH,
    meta: {
      label: 'Roles',
      icon: <ManageAccounts />
    }
  }
]}
```

Currently, it seems there is no easier way to achieve the reload on the menu click. What I mean here is that if my current tab is `Weight Calculator` and I click on it again, It just navigates to the path but it doesn't trigger remounting. Because of this, the UI gets reset but the form values stay persistent!

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I can do a nasty workaround using some sort of `useEffect` and state to check if the values have been reset and then upon that, I can reset the form as well so it just seems a bit of a hacky way to do this!

### Describe the thing to improve

I have 2 suggestions.
There can be an optional prop that ignores active tab click, So if the route and resource are on the same URL, Clicking on a resource will not trigger route change if this prop has been turned on

Alternatively, we can have a prop similar to `navigationProps` which contains settings related to navigations like `reload: boolean` etc!",,

1692144579,4258,[FEAT] Trigger getList function in custom data provider manually,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Is it possible to trigger `getList` function in custom data provider via `useDataGrid` hook manually? Currently, I had to call the `setFilters` function with unique key for each trigger needs. My problem is we have a toggle button in actions and we'd like to refresh datagrid's data(state) after toggle state is changed in a record.

My solution is: Send a same filter props and one unique key to bypass `React.memo`. There is an `useEffect` hook which listens every custom mutate so we are able to catch the toggle changes.
```  
useEffect(() => {
    if (customMutateData?.data) {
      setFilters([...filters, { field: Date.now().toString(), operator: 'eq', value: '' }]);
    }
  }, [customMutateData]);

1666033723,4164,[BUG] Multiple MUI Autocomplete not clearing previous search value,"### Describe the bug

When using `multiple` prop on an MUI Autocomplete with refines `useAutocomplete` when you search for the next value after selecting the one you have found, the options returned are what you seen in the previous search. It clears it self when you start typing.

The default MUI component doesn't have this behaviour, you can try it out via their [docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#multiple-values)



### Steps To Reproduce

1. Using tutorial edit the generated Categrory Autocomplete component for creating a blog post
2. You will have to not pass the `field` prop as it errors, and I don't know why, another bug?
3. Add the `multiple` prop to the Autocomplete component
4. Go to /blog-post/create
5. Type ""non"" in the Category and select the first option 
6. Click the Categrory option again, the same options will appear
7. If you type they will change

### Expected behavior

When clicking the component I'd expect the default list of options again, not the previous searched options.

1656363878,4097,[BUG] syncWithLocation sort not working properly,"### Describe the bug

The built-in `syncWithLocation` feature does not work correctly with the sort feature as it does not load onto the tables. It gets saved to the URL, but when the URL is loaded, the sort does not affect the table.


### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a Refine Repo
2. Create a list/table with `useList` or `useDataGrid`
3. Enable `syncWithLocation` in the `<Refine ... options={{ syncWithLocation: true }}  />`
4. Go on a view with a table, and play around with the sort (and perhaps filters & pagination)
5. Notice how they do get saved properly onto the URL search params.
6. Now copy and paste the URL containing a sort parameter onto a new tab
7. Upon loading in new tab, notice how the sort parameter is deleted from the URL and the sort is not used in the table.

### Expected behavior

The expected behaviour is that the sort parameters defined in the URL search params, properly load onto the table/list.

### Screenshot

### Before: As you can see the sort is set here and the URL search params reflect that

Hi folks

As far as I can tell, the inferencer cannot work without at least one record being present in the tables.

Is there any way at all to indicate to the server that the resource is being probed, eg have the inferencer set a header to let the server know that it's being probed and to send a temporary example resource if none are available at the requested URI?

I'd like to use this library in a project where end users will potentially delete all of a particular resource. I'd like them to still be able to add items when this happens.

Thank you

1648376191,4038,[DOC] Integration with Existing App?,"### Documentation issue

I don't see anything in the docs that describes how to integrate Refine with an already existing (e.g. Next.Js) application

### Describe the thing to improve

Is it even possible to really use the framework with an existing application? In certain situations (ours especially) we have an already deployed application for which we would love to add Refine as we are looking at the next phase of development that includes Admin & Reporting.

But everything I can see in the docs seems to imply that Refine wants to be used as its own standalone app

1647599370,4031,[FEAT] Improve `useParsed` through the ability to add Generic Types,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently when I'm using `useParsed` there's no option to add generic typing like you can add to `useParams` of React Router V6.

Your current implementation: [packages/core/src/hooks/router/use-parsed/index.tsx](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/3ec08ea2ec9a2c187f5b6d5df55e67c72bc8cf3e/packages/core/src/hooks/router/use-parsed/index.tsx)

Router Bindings for V6: [packages/react-router-v6/src/bindings.tsx#L87](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/react-router-v6/src/bindings.tsx#L87)

In the current version of Refine:
```tsx
const parsedParams = useParsed();
const { locale_id, provider_id } = parsedParams.params as any;
```

What you would want to do:
```tsx
const { locale_id, provider_id } = useParsed<{ params: { locale_id: string; provider_id: string } }>();
```

### Describe alternatives you've considered

The current alternative seems to be to use the following solution:

```tsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
...
const { locale_id, provider_id } = useParams<{ locale_id: string; provider_id: string }>();
```

### Additional context

I stumbled across this while searching for a solution for composite-primary-keys (CPK), which makes sense since we have lots of tables that have ""i18n"" clone-tables which have three primary keys. To access this information I need to have a route like: `/post/:id/:locale_id/:provider_id`

### Describe the thing to improve

Currently we're missing type-safety for the sake of simplicity. React Router V6 does this is a good manner, where you can pass a generic to `useParams`. Maybe we can teach `useParsed` this as well?

If the user has `user-manager` role, then after sign in, he will see a 404 page. Instead I would like him to redirect to `users` resource.

i am using `@pankod/refine-antd` and have custom `metaData` in `useShow`. But inside `Show` component, the `metaData` is'nt passed to the `RefreshButton` 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Using `headerButtons` and adding on top of `defaultButtons` works for now, but we will have 2 `RefreshButton` or we can recreate the whole `defaultButtons`  and passing the `metaData` to `RefreshButton` also works, but it might be easier if we can pass it to `Show` instead

### Describe the thing to improve

We may pass the `metaData` to `Show` and then pass it to `RefreshButton` for a quick solution.

Long term solution might be using `React.createContext` to create something like `MetadataProvider` and then it will be consumed by all relevant components like `RefreshButton`, `DeleteButton`

  const admin: User[] = Admin?.data ?? [];

hasPagination and pagination are working fine but filters and sort are not.

Id like to use only the RouteProvider, not the Router itself.
We have apps in microfronends and one hub. If you call the app from the hub, there is already an router defined. since you cant have 2 router in your project, this fails with refine currently.
Define the routes, without router, would fix this.

What is the difference between?
- `FileField` https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/mui/components/fields/file/
- `UrlField` https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/mui/components/fields/url/

Currently in the examples, it looks like both fields look and behave the exactly same.

Also IMO these example looks very artificial:

1611998585,3732,[BUG] Refine CLI not supported in yarn monorepos,"### Describe the bug

Since yarn workspaces use the root `node_modules` dir of the project instead of individual ones per package, 
refine CLI fails to resolve the `.bin` directory, because it's expected to be in the current directory relative to the package.json where `refine` is called.

The problem seems to be here https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/cli/src/commands/runner/projectScripts.ts#L3

It fails to find `./node_modules/.bin/next`

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a new refine nextjs app, called e.g. `my-admin`
2. Remove the package-lock.json and node_modules of the new refine app
3. Move it inside a yarn monorepo (Yarn Berry or not, I think it's not important)

I have currently some issues wrapping my head around how to access data from Hasura by using the refine Hasura dataprovider.
There is no Example using the MUI package with the `DataGrid` component in combination with Hasura so I tried to get bits and pieces from multiple sources.

1590723205,3635,[BUG] Date inference too sensitive,"### Describe the bug

Hi :)

In one of my resources I have a string field that for some reason the Inferencer recognizes as a date field.
The field values can be, for example: ""112312"", ""551351"", ""34223"", ""2222"" etc. The sole rule of this field that I can say for sure is that it is a string representation of a number with minimum 4 letters.

It gets inferred as date and so gives values such as ""12/01/1123,"" ""01/01/3333"", ""02/02/202"" etc.

### Steps To Reproduce

Not really sure what triggers this, but perhaps the value the Inferencer tries to infer from is at a length that seems reasonable for the inferring to be date; or even that when a string is only numbers the inferring is automatically date.

Anyway the reproduction is having a field of type string with number values with length of at least 4 letters.

### Expected behavior

Should be inferred as string or number, not date.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Get an empty refine app as boilderplate
2. Install `@pankod/refine-graphql`
3. Provide this URL (custom graphql server) https://nest-graphql-prisma-g5s7.onrender.com/graphql to initialise `GraphQLClient` from `@pankod/refine-graphql`
4. Use the following codeblock to initialise the `List of Payments` (where `Payment` is an entity from my custom GraphQL API)

```ts
<RefineSnackbarProvider>
  <Refine
    dataProvider={dataProvider(client)}
    Layout={Layout}
    ReadyPage={ReadyPage}

When `refine` executed queries, the query body is `query: ""query ($sort: String, $where: JSON, $start: Int, $limit: Int) { payment (sort: $sort, where: $where, start: $start, limit: $limit)  }`, but the schema on `payments` resolver has a different set of query argument which are: `where`, `orderBy`, `skip` and `take`

2. Windows laptop 2, I have successfully run the dev server twice until then the same thing happen like Windows laptop 1
3. MacOS laptop, I only successfully run the dev server once, but there are two conditions

This bug is present on repositories example antd from created with `npm create refine-app@latest`.

This bug is a problem from NextJS that does not by default transpile node_modules packages. So in case of some external modules does not export transpiled package this bug occur.

I have fixed this bug by adding the antd packages to the `next.config.js` file.
```
  transpilePackages: [
    '@pankod/refine-antd',
    'antd',
    '@ant-design/pro-components',
    '@ant-design/pro-layout',
    '@ant-design/pro-utils',
    '@ant-design/pro-provider',
    'rc-pagination',
    'rc-picker'
  ],
```
I also have upgraded the NextJS version to `13.1.6` to use this option.

I think this bug must be fixed on NextJS or on Antd package. But i created this issue here to keep a trace and potentially adding it to the documentation.
My first goal was to create this issue on Antd but some have already been created hand closed without fix. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- We need to add the `log` function to the many hooks depending on their data provider implementation.
- For example, if the data provider implements a `updateMany` method, we need to log the event in the `useUpdateMany` hook in a single transaction.

cf this discussion: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/3532#discussion_r1097461343

refine codebase is using query-string 7.x.x, while if we follow the instructions of the tutorial from scratch, we end up with a ""root"" node-module query-string versioned 8.x.x

The issue is that version 8.x.x don't expose `{ stringify }` as a member anymore:

```ts
// works in v7.x.x, doesn't work in v 8.x.x
// this is what is suggested to do on the tutorial docs, but the
// version we end up with is 8.x.x so it errors out
import { stringify } from ""query-string""

// works in v8.x.x
import queryString from ""query-string""

const { stringify } = queryString;
```

### Describe the solution (optional)

A solution would be or to use the new ""syntax"", but maybe we should bump the version on refine alltogether to avoid any confusion

Another way would be to import stringify from `@pankod/refine-simple-rest` so we are sure it is not dependent of any version of query-string.

An example of the generated code is

1561386440,3486,[FEAT] Custom ID for resources,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Hi,

Most of my resources have their PKs not as ""id"", but as some other custom ""x-id"", like ""resourceId"".
The Inferencer has a hard-coded assumption that the PK is ""id"", and so my resources aren't properly inference-d.

In most use-cases this is probably a non-issue because we can get the generated code and paste it to a specialized component and simply replace the ""id"" in this component. But my use-case is perhaps special, because I'm using the Inferencer generically and not taking the code it inferences; so I can't edit the code and use my custom ids instead of ""id"", i.e. I'm 100% relying on the Inferencer code.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

The reason I'm raising this issue, albeit perhaps only supporting a special case, is that I believe the fix might be quite easy - passing a prop for the id, instead of using hard-coded value ""id"". Obviously there will be a default value ""id"", but if the prop is given then use it instead.

This will probably be helpful for most other use-cases where we simply want the Inferencer to work properl in dev environment.

1538386035,3421,[DOC] How to do a mutation from authProvider,"### Documentation issue

I can't use `useCreate()` in `authProvider` since we're not in a React component.
How to do a mutation to the db table from `authProvider` ?

I'm using supabase as a back-end and I need to have more fields saved on the `user` table of supabase, so I created a `profile` table which is linked to the `user` table. Now I need to create that `profile` record after the user is registered, so I though of adding this to the `authProvider.ts`. But as I said earlier, I don't know how to make a mutation from that `register` function.

### Describe the thing to improve

Is doing this from the `authProvider` a good thing ? And how can I do so ?

1537200989,3417,[BUG] Strapi provider doesn't work well when searching for a null value,"### Describe the bug

Hi, I'm using Ant Design's  `Table` and `FilterDropdown` to make a table filter. When there's empty value (null in strapi), it calls the strapi backend with `http://localhost:1337/api/posts?filters[content][$eq]=null`, which will cause Strapi a 500 error. For querying null value, it should use something like `http://localhost:1337/api/posts?filters[content][$null]=true`, or `http://localhost:1337/api/posts?filters[content][$eq]=`.
Is there any way to get around it?

An alternative way would be, set the filter to an empty string. However currently if the filter is empty string, it clears all searches

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Build a content type with nullable fields in Strapi
2. Build a page which contains an Ant Design Table, and set a FilterDropdown for that field, with null value as an option
3. Apply the filter with null value

### Expected behavior

Strapi provider should handle null value searches without causing error

The underlying data that I have with my `dataProvider` periodically changes and the current offset-based pagination doesn't provide any guarantee of consistency. Instead of offset-based pagination, I want to pick a column (usually PK but not always integer / long) and filter based on that column with a cursor in the table component. Here are some use-cases where offset pagination is considered harmful. [1])(https://uxdesign.cc/why-facebook-says-cursor-pagination-is-the-greatest-d6b98d86b6c0), [2](https://dev.to/appwrite/this-is-why-you-should-use-cursor-pagination-4nh5)use cases

### Describe alternatives you've considered

If my table has a primary column that is integer/long, I can use `offset` in a way similar to cursor pagination but this approach doesn't work if the primary key is timestamp, string or a composite key. Also, even if the primary key is integer/long, the UX is not good as the values might be sparse instead of being incremental and continuous.

1527936851,3374,[BUG] DataGrid not changing loading state when mutating or invalidating data,"### Describe the bug

I am using a DataGridPro with row reordering functionality. Whenever I reorder rows I store new order into state and show a ""Save new order"" button. When user clicks this button I do the following:
1. Run a customMutation using `useCustomMutation` to send new row order to backend.
2. After that I invalidate query result using ""useInvalidate"". This way I'm trying to tell refine that this data needs to be refetched.

Pleaase don't mind red lines, it was about another issue.
</details>

What happens is that when I call `invalidate` I expect `useDataGridProps().dataGridProps.isLoading` property to switch from false to true, but this does not happen. Instead, my DataGrid simply gets silently updated without any loading indication.

I've asked this in Discord(https://discord.com/channels/837692625737613362/1062412321642786816), and @omeraplak helped and pointed that it might be a bug here: 
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/mui/src/hooks/useDataGrid/index.ts#L310

Probably that ""else"" block in ternary should be `isFetching` instead of `!isFetched`.
I could make a PR, but it can be a wrong assumption, so I'd better not.

### Steps To Reproduce

Described in description.

Except you don't really need to have DataGridPro component, simply add some invalidation to your resource list by button click, that would be enough to see the behaviour.

### Expected behavior

DataGrid shows loading progress when data (or resource) it's using get's invalidated and (re-)fetched.

### Describe the thing to improve

1.Out of curiosity, I removed the resource pages from the `_app.tsx` file to see the results. It significantly reduced the bundle size:
```
┌   /_app                                  0 B             292 kB
├ λ /[[...refine]]                         249 B           292 kB
└ ○ /404                                   184 B           292 kB
+ First Load JS shared by all              292 kB
  ├ chunks/framework-305dbdef56d67aa9.js   45.4 kB
  ├ chunks/main-a8eaa706e962a5d6.js        27.9 kB
  ├ chunks/pages/_app-432b4edb6ea69894.js  217 kB
  └ chunks/webpack-44567bfec3a37904.js     1.05 kB
```
The fact that I have to import all resource pages in the `_app.tsx` file to pass them to `<Refine>` has a significant effect on the bundle size and speed of my app. I wish there was a way to at least lazy load them.

2. I have to import Material UI components using named imports:
```ts
import { Button } from ""@pankod/refine-mui"";
``` 
But the [Material UI docs suggests](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/) to import the components using default imports to improve bundle size in dev mode:
```ts
import Button from ""@pankod/refine-mui/Button"";
```
This is not possible with `@pankod/refine-mui` because it only re-exports mui components with named export.

3. Next.js recently introduced a new compiler option, `modularizeImports` that automatically converts named imports to default imports:
```ts
// before:
import { Delete } ""@mui/icons-material""
// after:
import Delete ""@mui/icons-material/Delete""
```
To enable it I just need to add this to my `next.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  modularizeImports: {
    ""@mui/icons-material"": {
      transform: ""@mui/icons-material/{{member}}"",
    },
  },
};
```
This is very handy for packages like `@mui/icons-material`. It significantly reduces the compile time in dev mode. It doesn't effect the production build because `@mui/icons-material` is side-effect free (at least this is what I've been told, I don't have deep knowledge about how bundles work).
It also could be used with `@mui/material` but not your version of mui (`@pankod/refine-mui/`) so 1) we can't reduce compile time in dev mode with this option 2) it potentially effects the production build because `@pankod/refine-mui` is not side-effect free(?)

Again, I'm not very familiar with this topic. These are just my raw thoughts.

- Go to the package.json and add the following key:
```
""workspaces"": [
  ""apps/*""
]
```
- Create and go to apps dir
- Create a refine project with `npm create refine-app@latest refine-app` using next.js + yarn
- Go to refine-app dir
- Run `yarn dev`
- See `Something went wrong when trying to get installed 'refine' packages.` on the console

The $contains operator should be case-insensitive and $containss case-sensitive according to refine documentation of the CRUD operators

This mapping is opposite to strapi-v4 documentation:
https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest/filtering-locale-publication.html#filtering

E.g., if one uses $containss (case-sensitive) with strapi-V4 data provider, this operator is mapped to $containsi (i for insensitive in Strapi naming convention)

### Steps To Reproduce

Any use of $contains, $containss, $ncontains or $ncontainss lead the a wrong operator mapping.

1516409277,3332,[BUG] Material-UI createTheme does not expose MuiDataGrid,"### Describe the bug

If one wants to customize the DataGrid via the main theme, Typescript throws an error because MuiDataGrid is not present in the components object of the Theme object. The @mui/x-data-grid docs recommend [adding a type augmentation](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/getting-started/#typescript), but since the createTheme that we get is from the refine library and not mui directly, we can't use the augmentation.

As a workaround, setting the object passed to createTheme as any allows us to style the DataGrid, but we lose Typescript for it.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a theme via the `@pankod/refine-mui`-exposed `createTheme`
2. Use the following structure:
 ```
 components: { 
  MuiDataGrid: {
    styleOverrides: {
      cell: {
        borderBottom: ""1px solid black !important""
      }

1508058549,3308,[BUG] Hasura Data Provider - Allow remote schemas and possibility to change ID type,"### Describe the bug

When a remote schema is imported into Hasura, the grouping relationships are called as {table}_aggregated instead of {table}_aggregate. Right now the Hasura dataProvider always expects that the name of the aggregation table is suffixed with aggregated.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116877667/209162163-66df2b72-bd9a-4a90-9904-2c33e32d1c9c.png)

We can see this in https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/hasura/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L215
Aggregate Problem

```
const hasuraFilters = generateFilters(filters);

            const operation = metaData?.operation ?? resource;

            const aggregateOperation = `${operation}_aggregate`;

            const hasuraSortingType = `[${operation}_order_by!]`;
            const hasuraFiltersType = `${operation}_bool_exp`;
```


The same goes for the Hasura id field, which is forced by the data provider to be a uuid and cannot be of the numeric or string type.

https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/next/packages/hasura/src/dataProvider/index.ts#L162

UUID Problem

```
        getOne: async ({ resource, id, metaData }) => {
            const operation = `${metaData?.operation ?? resource}_by_pk`;

            const { query, variables } = gql.query({
                operation,
                variables: {
                    id: { value: id, type: ""uuid"", required: true },
                    ...metaData?.variables,
                },
                fields: metaData?.fields,
            });

            const response = await client.request(query, variables);

            return {
                data: response[operation],
            };
        },
```


Is it possible to parameterize these cases in some way or give a solution to the problem?

### Steps To Reproduce

**For aggregated problem:**

1. Go to Hasura and export a remote Schema
2. Try to get the list through Hasura Data Provider with useList hook.
3. Try to execute the next query generated by the dataProvider: 

query: ""query ($limit: Int, $offset: Int, $where: users_test_bool_exp) { users_test (limit: $limit, offset: $offset) { id, name, lastname, email, genre, role } users_test_aggregate (where: $where) { aggregate { count } } }""
variables: {limit: 20, offset: 0}

**For uuid problem:**

You could find this problem is your example case of Hasura DataProvider when you try to access to the detail of a post:
1. Install your hasura data provider sample: npm create refine-app@latest -- --example data-provider-hasura
2. access to: http://localhost:3000/posts

3. Access to the detail of a post:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116877667/209164234-01157fe4-7fe3-4bbe-929f-b99582690556.png)

4. See the network error
{""errors"":[{""extensions"":{""code"":""validation-failed"",""path"":""$.selectionSet.posts_by_pk.args.id""},""message"":""variable 'id' is declared as 'uuid!', but used where 'Int!' is expected""}]}

Give the possibility of defining these use cases for different data schemas by parameterization.

1501281421,3259,[BUG] Your next.js starter app has issues,"### Describe the bug

I found a couple of issues with your next.js starter app.
```ts
// pages/[[...refine]].tsx
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
  // const { resource, action, id } = handleRefineParams(context.params?.refine);

  const { isAuthenticated, ...props } = await checkAuthentication(
    authProvider,
    context
  );

  const i18nProps = await serverSideTranslations(context.locale ?? ""en"", [
    ""common"",
  ]);

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return { props: { ...props, ...i18nProps } };
  }

  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(context.locale ?? ""en"", [""common""])),
    },
  };
};
```
1. `i18nProps` is already calculated and stored in a variable so don't need to run `await serverSideTranslations(context.locale ?? ""en"", [""common""])` again. It should be:
```ts
  return {
    props: {
      ...i18nProps,
    },
  };
```
2. Here `props` could be any valid return value of `getServerSideProps`. 
```ts
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return { props: { ...props, ...i18nProps } };
  }
```
For example it could be a redirect, but your are spreading it into the `props` ? I think it should be something like this:
```ts
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return {
      ...props,
      // @ts-ignore
      props: { ...(props?.props ? props.props : {}), ...i18nProps },
    };
  }
```
Now redirects work. I had to add `@ts-ignore` because otherwise I would get a wired typescript error that I couldn't resolve.

If I know where is your next.js starter app code, I would update it myself.

1491780661,3207,[BUG] Can't serve the app from a subdirectory,"### Describe the bug

I exactly followed your instructions on [`Serving the application from a subdirectory`](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/#serving-the-application-from-a-subdirectory) (with react-location) but it didn't work. Another guy who I believe is a core team member confirmed that it's a bug in [`discord`](https://discord.com/channels/837692625737613362/1019855665633706044/threads/1051820059867234324)

Here is the bug report that I posted on discord:

I want the base path of my app be `/admin/`. So for example the users list page would be `/admin/users`. I followed your instructions : `Serving the application from a subdirectory`
I have a `CustomRouterComponent` component:
```ts
const { RouterComponent, location } = routerProvider;

const CustomRouterComponent = () => (
  <RouterComponent location={location} basepath=""/admin"" />
);
```
And I give it to`<Refine>`:
```ts
routerProvider={{
  ...routerProvider,
  RouterComponent: CustomRouterComponent,
}}
```
Now when I open `/admin` it automatically redirects to `/admin/users` which is a good sign but nothing renders on that page and any other page in my app. I don't get any wired error on the console. I don't get a 404. Just nothing renders. All pages are empty.

**I'm using Vite+React+TS+React location**. All of my dependencies all up-to-date. I've also tried to set `base` to `/admin/` in `vite.config.ts` but it didn't help:
```ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: ""/admin/"",
});
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a Refine app with React and React Location
2. Follow the instructions https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/#serving-the-application-from-a-subdirectory

1489802082,3187,[BUG] Refine Antd + Vite fails in production build,"### Describe the bug

I think it's an issue similar to https://bytemeta.vip/repo/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/issues/2962

When building a project with Refine/Antd and Vite there's an error on the browser `generatePickerExports is not a function`. 
It seems that the issue is due to imports from CommonJS modules in AntD and not ESModules as vite requires.

I've patched node_modules/@pankod/refine-antd/dist/esm/index.js to make it work (replacing picker imports from `lib` to `es` and it seem to resolve the issue.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a new refine project with Antd and Vite.
2. Set `  build: {
    minify: false
  },` in `vite.config.ts`.
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm run preview`
5. Open a browser and see the error

The [Material UI Tutorial](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorials/material-ui-tutorial/) has incorrect directory references for the boilerplate project. 

At [""Create a List Page""](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorials/material-ui-tutorial/#creating-a-list-page), the instructions say to create a directory ""interfaces"" under ""/src"". However, the ""list.tsx"" file calls the interface like it's a library `import { IPost } from ""interfaces""` not a relative directory. 

Later in the step, when adding `import { PostList } from ""pages/posts""` it's the same issue - that's not a relative file or directory. It's calling it like a library. 

### Describe the thing to improve

Inside ""src/pages/posts/list.tsx"" revise from `import { IPost } from ""interfaces""` to `import { IPost } from ""../../interfaces""`.

```
{

        {
            ""loc"": [
                ""path"",

I've found an issue already that deals with this use case and have gotten to the point where I can catch the error using the `onMutationError` hook, but I can't figure out how to change the Material IU form refine uses to show the errors properly. See here: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/issues/1681

I am using the JWT authentication on my project and it works fine when I log in and save the access token in my local or session storage. But whenever my refresh token is expired and the server responds with 401 status the user gets logged out which is fine. When the user is logged out the redirect URL must be the resource that the user is trying to access instead the redirect URL will be `/login`.

The steps to reproduce the issues is on the above link.

### Expected behavior

Let us say I am trying to access the **users** resource from the menu but my refresh token is expired then I will be redirected to the login page with the URL as `<domain>/login?to=/login` instead of `<domain>/login?to=/users`

I'd love to have a prop on the Buttons (`ListButton`, `EditButton`, `ShowButton`, `DeleteButton`) (e.g `showWhenUnauthorized` - default: `true` ) to avoid showing unauthorized buttons **at all**, as they **should not** be clicked by basic users, so it' useless to even show them ",,
1414526798,2828,[BUG] Disable click on <*Button>s when unauthorized,"### Describe the bug

Right now my ""basic user"" should only be able to see (not edit) a list, and its detail. 
Using `<EditButton>` in the List actions column instead makes the button appear as `disabled` (**but still clickable**).

When clicked you're (of course) redirected to a 404 page.

~~I'd also love to have a prop on the Buttons (`ListButton`, `EditButton`, `ShowButton`, `DeleteButton`) (e.g `showWhenUnauthorized` - default: `true` ) to avoid showing unauthorized buttons **at all**, as they **should not** be clicked by basic users, so it' useless to even show them~~



### Steps To Reproduce

1. Setup providers to set ""can: false"" on some resource/actions
2. Create a `<ShowButton>` or `<EditButton>` for given resource/action
3. Click on the button

### Expected behavior

You should

1- Not be redirected to a 404 page
~~2- (Even better) Not see the disabled button at all (maybe behind a `showWhenUnauthorized` prop)~~

1403472132,2692,[BUG] useSelect Ignores fetchSize,"### Discussed in https://github.com/pankod/refine/discussions/2691

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **vinclou** October 10, 2022</sup>
### Deps:

    `""@pankod/refine-antd"": ""^3.53.0"",`
    `""@pankod/refine-core"": ""^3.78.0"",`

### Example:

```tsx
	const { selectProps: someDataSelectProps } = useSelect<SomeData>({
		resource: 'someResource',
		fetchSize: 5,
		optionValue: 'id',
		optionLabel: 'displayName',
		queryOptions: {
			enabled: true,
			staleTime: Timer.FifteenMinutes
		}
	})
```

This will get you the correct data back, but in the network tab you will see 2 queries being made one `without params` and another one with correct pageSize params which are -> `pageSize: 5`

ex:
```js
Req One: SomeData
Req Two: SomeData/page=0&pageSize=5
```

I'm a bit confused about why is there a fetchSize option if it fetches all data on initial render that exists anyway?

Clarification: If you use useList, with overridden pagination, it will work and make expected 1 query only
```tsx
	const res = useList<SomeData>({
		resource: 'someResource',
		config: {
			pagination: {
				current: 1,
				pageSize: 100
			},
			filters: [
				{
					field: 'sort',
					operator: 'eq',
					value: 'NameAsc'
				}
			]
		},
		queryOptions: {
			enabled: true,
			staleTime: Timer.Hour
		}
	})
```

When using [time picker](https://ant.design/components/time-picker/#header) from Ant Design, the value of `form.item` is a timestamp which includes time and date. Therefore, when we try to update the value to the database, we get an error : ""_invalid input syntax for type time_"".

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Refer to [antd example](https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/next/examples/tutorial/antd/src/pages/posts/edit.tsx), replace `<Form.Item>...</Form.Item>` with following codes
```
<Form.Item

When we use time picker, we want to get only the time without date so we can update the value to the databse.

1381445821,2561,[BUG] Sider is breaking the app when submenu items has `icon`,"**Describe the bug**
When you have a resource with `icon` and `parentName` property, `Sider` is breaking the app with error on `react-query`.

**To Reproduce**
Create a resource with both `icon` and `parentName` properties.

**Expected behavior**
Should render the icon and the menu successfully

**Additional context**
This is happening because we've wrapped the `SubMenu` items in Siders of `antd` and `mui` packages with `CanAccess` component which is a wrapper around the `useCan` hook and this hook uses `useQuery` from `react-query`. We're providing all the parameters we have to the `key` value of the query and this fails to stringify because of the react/html elements if there are any.

1380697315,2556,[BUG] undoable mutation is called many times,"**Describe the bug**
When updating multiple records at the same time whose mutationMode is `undoable`, the `doMutation()` method is called multiple times leading to duplicate API calls for the dataProvider.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a list page where multiple records are shown.  useUpdate or useUpdateMany works best for this.  Ensure the mutation function for the records defines `mutationMode: ""undoable""`
2. Edit one of the records.
3. While the toast message from step 2 is still shown, update different record.
4. While the toast message from step 2 is still shown, update the same record from step 2 _again_

**Expected behavior**
Viewing the network calls made from the browser, you will see that many more API calls to the dataProvider endpoint were executed.  You would expect that with 3 updates made, only 3 API calls would have been performed.

**Screenshots**
I've modified the `refine-advanced-table-example` with the following changes in order to better represent this issue:
1. The ""Delete selected items"" button is not disabled while waiting for the success of the undoable mutation.
2. The `useDeleteMany` mutation has been changed to `useUpdateMany` so that records are not removed and can be modified multiple times.

I believe these changes provide a more simplistic use case which serves to demonstrate the issue.  Disabling the ""Delete selected items"" button is definitely a work around for this issue, but a requirement to disable the user from disabling any edit functionality is not clearly mentioned in documentation.

1354837016,2385,"[BUG] DataGrid Pro does not style, night mode doesn't work and getRowClassName function","**Describe the bug**
I changed the package DataGrid from '@pankod/refine-mui' to DataGridPro from '@mui/x-data-grid-pro' to use more functions, but it didn't show compatibility with the refine style, I also tried to use the getRowClassName function but without success.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the package - @mui/x-data-grid-pro
2. Use DataGridPro component
3. Change the night mode or add the getRowClassName function
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
Styling adapt to night mode and row colors change when calling getRowClassName function.

Reason for that is propbably, that after loading the previos page refine adds the query parameters back to the URL. By pressing the back button the next time, the browser reloads the same page without the query parmeters -> query parameters are added  again -> and so on...

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
    - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { ""querystring"": require.resolve(""querystring-es3"") }'
    - install 'querystring-es3'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
    resolve.fallback: { ""querystring"": false }

1321139518,2246,[FEAT] Please make the PageHeader extra extensible,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently the views such as `Show`, `Edit`, `Create`, `List` etc. offer default buttons in the PageHeader `extra`. This is good because these default buttons inherit many things such as `recordItemId`, `dataProviderName` etc from the parent view component and auto-configure themselves.

The problem is, when we need to add additional buttons **before** and **after** the default buttons. For example, in the `Show` view I already get a `RefreshButton` by default and would like to add a `Download` button before the built-in Refresh Button.

This requires me to rewrite everything in the PageHeader `extra` (including all the configuration of `recordItemId`, `dataProviderName` etc required for the built-in buttons).

There is no way to just **prepend** and **append** few buttons to the already existing built-in buttons.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

- Kindly allow extra ReactNode contents to be **prepended** and **appended** to the built-in Page Header components (instead of overwriting them)

For example, 
- Should be able to add few `ReactNode`s  **before** the built-in `extra` components and **after** the built-in `extra` components in the `PageHeader`

1318223462,2220,[FEAT] Pass the full resource to the `accessControlProvider` `can` method,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When making use of the `accessControlProvider` for authorization, it would be useful to have access to the full resource object. This will enable Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), for example granting permissions based on the value of a field in the resource object.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the `can` function, pass in the full object as a parameter, rather than just the ID.
```
<Refine
      accessControlProvider={{
        can: async ({ action, params, resource }) => {
```

Users can then make decisions based on any field in the resource.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
You could do a separate call to get the resource again from the backend but that is going to double the load on your service.

**Additional context**
Any ABAC supporting authorization system, such as [Cerbos](https://cerbos.dev), is going to need this.",,

1315845440,2196,[DOCS] How to generate automatic typescript types from your graphql schema. [Hasura],"**Is this issue related to an existing part of the documentation? If so, please provide a link**
I am not sure about this

**Describe the thing to improve**
A clear and concise description of problems.

**If you are using Hasura as backend service, you may want to generate typescript types for your queries/mutation and use them with refine.** 

**Step 1.** Export graphql schema file from hasura. You can follow this [guide](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/guides/export-graphql-schema/)  

I will use apollo's new `rover cli`. Install apollo rover cli using following command
`npm install --save-dev @apollo/rover`

Generate Graphql schema using the following command.
`npx rover graph introspect http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql -H ""X-Hasura-Admin-Secret:adminsecretkey"" | out-file  schema.graphql -encoding utf8`

If you are curious about the `-encoding utf8` flag read [here](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/653)

**Step 2.** Generate typescript types from  `schema.graphql` file

Create a file `codegen.yml` in the same level where your `package json` exist

```
schema: schema8.graphql
generates:
  ./src/generated.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typed-document-node
```

Install required packages using following command
`npm i -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typed-document-node @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations`

My `devDependencies` tree look like this now

```json
""devDependencies"": {
    ""@apollo/rover"": ""^0.7.0"",
    ""@graphql-codegen/cli"": ""^2.9.1"",
    ""@graphql-codegen/typed-document-node"": ""^2.3.2"",
    ""@graphql-codegen/typescript"": ""^2.7.2"",
    ""@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations"": ""^2.5.2"",
    ""@types/graphql"": ""^14.5.0"",
    ""apollo"": ""^2.34.0"",
    ""graphql"": ""^16.5.0""
  }
```

Add `codegen` script cmd in `package.json` to generate types
```
 ""scripts"": {
    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",
    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",
    ""test"": ""react-scripts test"",
    ""eject"": ""react-scripts eject"",
    ""codegen"": ""graphql-codegen --config ./codegen.yml""
  },
```
Now run `npm run codegen` and and new file `generated.ts` will be created inside `src` directory

If you write useStepForm({isBackValidate:false}) it works.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. `useForm` with an action ""create"" and a `Create` view component with a form
2. on submitting the form, let the server return 403 `unAuthorized` error

Uncaught promise errors are not good for code. Catching and handling this would be good.

On Strapi, you can use **objects** to make deep filters (https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest/filtering-locale-publication.html#deep-filtering)
Example:
```
filters: {
    chef: {
      restaurants: {
        stars: {
          $eq: 5,
        },
      },
    },
},
```

Refine, only allows **arrays**, with logical filters or conditional filters  (https://refine.dev/docs/guides-and-concepts/data-provider/handling-filters/):
Example:
```
const filter = [
    {
        field: ""name"",
        operator: ""eq"",
        value: ""John"",
    },

I can cheat the URL constructor doing this:

```
const filter = [
    {
        field: ""chef[restaurants][stars"",
        operator: ""eq"",
        value: ""John"",

> Unhandled Runtime Error
> Error: Failed prop type: The prop `href` expects a `string` or `object` in `<Link>`, but got `undefined` instead.
> Open your browser's console to view the Component stack trace.

After testing with several versions, it looks to me this started happening in the change from `3.32.0` to `3.34.0` (seems like `Link` behaviour was changed in that patch). 

The implementation of the button itself is exactly as shown in the docs:

1293733510,2095,[FEAT] Differentiate between refetch() and normal query,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We have caching behavior to reduce the latency from DB retrieval. Normal query responses are cached on the server side for short time (e.g. couple of minutes), to avoid duplicate query execution within short span of time, unless a **forced refresh** happens manually by the user where the cache will be discarded and query runs fully again.

However, on the frontend side, I do not see anyway to mark the `refetch` call as different (than the usual query of `useShow` etc.). 

In other words, the server does not know when to use cache and when to force refresh, based on the calls info.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Can Refine mark the `refetch` calls with some kind of header (`x-refetch`) etc.?

Currently there is no way to access the original error message received by the axios response.

1290164625,2077,[BUG] Strapi-V4 useMany has implicit pagination and pageSize,"**Describe the bug**

Let´s suppose I query strapi with this useMany hook and the ids array have 100 ids:

```
const postQueryResult = useMany<IPost>({
    resource: ""posts"",
    ids: [1, 2,3,4,5,6 ... 96,97,98,99,100],
});

```
Strapi will only return the first 25 ids and refine wont call a warning or throw an error.
As for default, strapi imposes a 25 items limit on its API: https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/optional/api.html

For default, on refinejs code, I cant set a pagination to increase the amount of ids strapi should response, but this pagination is available on other hooks.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make a useMany query with more than 25 ids
2. Check response and you will se it will be limited to 25 ids.

**Expected behavior**
It would be ideal for refine.js throw a warning and a property/method to be available to change pagination, as there is on useTable hook.

**Additional context**
I don´t know yet how to do a pull request on strapi, I tried to do some changes on efine-strapi-v4 code but I couldn´t build it. It says CJS error (or something like this). 

If you open https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/next/packages/strapi-v4/src/dataProvider.ts and look at getList function (line 137), it seems that you can just copy hasPagination and pagination  propeties and its code to the getMany function and it may solve the issue.

1287764620,2067,[BUG] refineCoreProps is ignored when using initialState with useTable from @pankod/refine-react-table,"**Describe the bug**
When using `useTable` from `@pankod/refine-react-table` and passing both `initialState` and `refineCoreProps` the latter gets ignored.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Bootstrap a sample application following the [tutorial](https://refine.dev/docs/core/tutorial/) for headless refine up until the `Handling relationships` section. 
2. On the posts list page add this
```js
{
        id: 'category',
        Header: 'Category ID',
        accessor: 'category.id',
},
```
to the columns object and set `hiddenColumns` and `initialSorter` in the `useTable` hook like this:
```js
const { getTableProps, getTableBodyProps, headerGroups, prepareRow, rows } = useTable({
    columns,
    initialState: { hiddenColumns: ['createdAt'] },
    refineCoreProps: { initialSorter: [{ field: 'category.id', order: 'asc' }] },
});
```

**Expected behavior**
I would expect to not see the `createdAt` column anymore and to have the table sorted based on `category.id`, however the table is not sorted. If I remove `initialState: { hiddenColumns: ['createdAt'] }`, then `refineCoreProps` gets evaluated and the table is sorted accordingly.

1287704402,2066,[FEAT] Allow sorting on a related table field using supabase dataprovider,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Right now a table can only be sorted on its own fields, it would be useful to allow sorting on a related table field.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Using the `metaData` arguments we could add to the `getList` method something like this right before line 118
```js
metaData?.sort?.map((item) => {
    query.order(item.field, { foreignTable: item.foreignTable, ascending: item.order === ""asc"" });
});
```

This would allow the user to pass an object like this to `useTable` to obtain the table correctly sorted
```js
{
    metaData: {
        select: '*, categories(*)'
        sort: [{ 
            field: 'title',
            foreignTable: 'categories',
            order: 'asc' 
        }]
    }
}
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative solutions could be to allow the use of a field `foreignTable` inside `initialSorter`, `permanentSorter` ecc.. and update lines 118-120 of the `getList` method to this
```js
sort?.map((item) => {
    query.order(item.field, { ascending: item.order === ""asc"", foreignTable: item.foreignTable });
});
```

**Additional context**
In both of these solutions the user would still be required to pass a custom `select` operation to `metaData`, as illustrated above,  since the related table must be present inside the select clause for supabase to not give an error

1. React complains about the ilegal invocation: 
```

1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.

2. Keyboard controls of the data grid stop working after clicking / focusing the cell with the ilegal invocation.

Default sider mixes dark and light AntD themes in its children. I have been checking and it seems that the issue comes from AntD as it has different defaults for the Layout.Sider component, and the Menu component, the first default to dark and the later to light theme.

If you want to use your own css extended from the default AntD you have to mix light and dark configurations which shouldn't be needed.

**To Reproduce**
It's as easy as using the default AntD styles instead of the Refine provided one ""antd/dist/antd.css"". If you do that in the default generated application that you get following the tutorial you get a sider that mixes dark and light themes. See screenshot below.

**Expected behavior**
The theme setup should be consistent between the default provided elements so it's possible to easily override it using AntD styles. One solution may be to set a default dark or light and provide an option to override it on the Sider.

**To Reproduce**
Create a new project according to the walkthrough steps provided tutorial (https://refine.dev/docs/ui-frameworks/antd/tutorial/)
1. Create an EditPost page
2. Adding Form.Item for the ""publishedAt""
3. Go back to Posts list page and edit any error
4. See error mentioned above

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: 101.0.4951.64 (Official Build) (x86_64)
 - Used dataProvider refine-simple-rest (https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev)

I'm using javascript and this is how I put the date picker in my EditPost page:
       <Form.Item label=""Published At"" name=""publishedAt"">
          <DatePicker />
        </Form.Item>

1238384327,1810,[BUG] syncWithLocation doesn't track URL changes,"**Describe the bug**
In the `useTable` hook `sycnWithLocation` was not watching the `URL` changes. As a result, the values followed by the URL, such as pagination, were not reset to initial values when the same resource was selected from the Sider.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Enable `syncWithLocation`
2. Go to any listing page
3. Make a filter/pagination/sorting
4. Click the same resource item from the `Sider` menu
5. See URL

**Expected behavior**

The page should return to the `initialState` when the same resource is called.
",,
1236277787,1806,[FEAT] Preserve query params when navigating from list to edit and back ,"
When a table/list is being displayed and filtered, the user clicks the edit button  and navigates to the edit page. 
Once they are finished in the edit page it would be cool to have the option of returning to previous page in the navigation history rather than refreshing the page with the same data being displayed.

for example when A user selects from the Table filter dropdown for example  lets say the the url is 
""http://localhost:3000/tags?tagType=21&pageSize=50""
then.. when i click the edit button =>  edit page =>  save it returns me to ""localhost:3000/tags""

ideally you should be able to return to 
""http://localhost:3000/tags?tagType=21&pageSize=50"" if you would like

1232718526,1794,[BUG] @pankod/refine-nhost is not handling graphQL error responses,"**Describe the bug**
The `@nhost/nhost-js` does not throw errors for graphQL errors, instead it returns `error` field in the return value. Callers are expected to check for the `error` field in the return values and act appropriately.

https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/19ccc5ab0d69ba516305548678e09807809845c3/packages/nhost-js/src/clients/graphql.ts#L55-L60
 
However,
The `refine-nhost` is not considering this situation and is not handling the error return values.

This is leading to situation where the error message is eaten away by the `refine-nhost` and no way for the app or caller to know about the graphQL error responses. App gets a ""success"" notification, but the backend does not have the data and no way to know about it (since console log also does not show any errors).

**To Reproduce**
Use `refine-nhost` to make a graphQL query that returns errors (such as permission error) etc.

**Expected behavior**
Error message should be thrown or notification should be displayed

findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an instance of DomWrapper which is inside StrictMode. Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference.

1209206974,1735,[DOC] Dependent Queries ,"## Is this issue related to an existing part of the documentation? If so, please provide a link

1. Added helpful info on using dependent queries from React Query.
2. Refine documentation page: https://refine.dev/docs/core/hooks/data/useMany/
3. React query documentation page: https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/dependent-queries

## Describe the thing to improve
Dependent query is useful in a case where there are queries that depend on a preceding query's results.  This can be added to the Refine documentation to make the documentation more robust.

Personally, I ran into a problem where I had 5 queries, 4 of which depend on the first query's result. What happens is all 5 queries appear to run synchronously on load and 4 error messages popped up once before running successfully for the second time. The random error messages popping up can be distracting for the end user. This issue can be resolved with the use of dependent queries from React Query's useQuery options. 

## Describe the solution (optional)

I can create a pull request and add the following to the documentation: 

:::tip
`useQuery` options also allows you to implement dependent query whereby a query is only executed after a particular query result is fetched. This is particularly useful if you have queries that are dependent on the query results of a preceding query.  

[Refer to react-query docs on **dependent queries** for more information.](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/dependent-queries)

-   Suppose you want this query to run after `id_query_result` is fetched by a preceding query, you can set  `enabled` to `!!id_query_result`. 

```tsx
const categoryQueryResult = useMany<ICategory>({
    resource: ""categories"",
    ids: ids_query_result,
    queryOptions: { enabled: !!id_query_result },
});
```

1207364408,1729,[BUG] Problems with useForm inside Custom Page (antd UI framework),"I'm trying to make an Edit page for a resource, using a Custom Page. But I'm having some problems with the `useForm` hook, using the antd `Form` component.

1. The `useForm` hook doesn't automatically fetch the initial data, to populate the Form. I had to manually fetch it, using the hook `useOne`, and fill the data inside the form. I'm already setting the `resource` parameter inside the `useForm` hook and `Edit` component (with `recordItemId` aswell), but it only works for the form submit.
2. The `<Input>` fields inside the `<Form.Item>` fields don't update the value prop that I've set, using a variable with `useState`. But it works fine if I put the `<Input>` field outside the `Form` component. I've fixed it using the `form` return value of the hook `useForm`, and manually calling the function `form.setFieldsValue({ name });` when the field value changes.
3. The `<RefreshButton>` uses the URL from the page to refetch the resource, instead of using the provided `resource` parameter of the `useForm` hook. I had to manually set the RefreshButton inside the Form (using `pageHeaderProps`), and use the `refetch` return value of the hook `useOne`, and set the data manually for it to work.

Here is the code that I've implemented to make it work:

`App.tsx`:

1206068547,1724,[FEAT] Nested resources,"I have an API endpoint that goes like: `/api/admin/stores/:store_id/employees/:id`
Where `:store_id` and `:id` can both be an integer.

I would like to be able to create nested resources like this (for example: Employees resources that belongs to a specific Store).

I don't know if this is possible with the current multi-level menu, I've checked the documentation but it doesn't include the `:store_id` part in the URL, nor in the hooks (useList, etc) API requests.

Does anyone know how to implement this feature with the current version of refine? Or is it impossible right now?

My suggestion would be to approach this with a React Context, storing the selected `:store_id` (from a Select input, for example), and passing as a parameter to the resource, but I'm guessing the only way to do this is by creating a Custom Page and implement the API request with axios or something.

Hi guys, I've some questions when I tried to use `useDrawerForm` (v.3.6.3). I intended to use this hook to managing contextual data (like relations). so I use this hook in the page that use `useShow` to show the detail of the parent data, `useTable` to list the children, and `useDrawerForm` to create and edit the children. 

1. When I use this hook with action create, it show clone tag on the header, how can i remove this tag? And after i save it, and then click a create button again, it show the data that i've input before, can i reset this form?

2. When I use this hook with action edit. after I save the data, it will call an API to retrieve the updated data but with wrong id (it use parentId), I've set redirect to false on the options, but it still happen, is there a way to disable API call after update?

**Expected behavior**
1. The page header should be no `clone` tag, and after submit the form should be reset
2. After edit and submit, the id is should be the `childId` not the `parentId`

 However, `useDelete`'s callback does not allow the passing of any data along.
I suggest adding this capability, just as in `useCreate`, `useUpdate` etc.

My specific usecase is telling the server whether this is a ""soft"" delete"" or a ""hard"" delete

```ts
const { mutate: delete } = useDelete()
const deleteCategory = (catId) => delete({
    resource: ""categories"",

})
const archiveCategory = (catId) => delete({

    id: catId,
    values: { hard: false },
})

1165292063,1627,[FEAT] Add support for `and` conditional filter,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Now that the conditional or filter is available (see https://github.com/pankod/refine/issues/1417) it would be cool to have a complementary `and` filter such that the following query becomes possible:

```sql
OR(
  AND(
    {title} == ""The Great Divide"",
    {age} < 10,
  ),
  AND(
    {title} == ""The New Era"",
    {age} < 20,
  )
)
```

This would allow to construct complex filters for different situations. Currently it's only possible to do the following:
```sql
AND(
  OR(
    {title} == ""The Great Divide"",
    {title} == ""The New Era"",
  ),
  OR(
    {age} < 10,
    {age} < 20,
  )
)
```

One can notice however that these are not the same and the condition for the age is now not tied to the specific titles and in this example `{age} < 10` actually being useless since `{age} < 20` already satisfies it.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An additional `and` filter based on the same principle as the `or` filter.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The top-level implicit `AND` that already exists is good but does limit the queries we can construct if we need to narrow down results individually.

While using the `Create` component from the `@pankod/refine-antd ` package with a i18nProvider I noticed the default page title for a resource was not being translated and even when the resource was invalid or undefined it just tried to look for `undefined.titles.create`.

I would be awesome to be able to define a translation for the fallback message when keys like `product.titles.create` don´t exist. (code reference: https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/master/packages/antd/src/components/crud/create/index.tsx#L81)

For now I will translate every resource manually or create a hook to do this automatically. I'm still thinking about it.

1. Create initial state:
```tsx
const [doRefetch, setDoRefetch] = useState(false);
```
2. Use **query options** in `useEditableTable`. See here more detail [useEditableTable API](https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/hooks/table/useEditableTable/#api)

3. Prepare for fetch on mount
```tsx
const refetchQuery = useCallback(() => {
 setDoRefetch(true)

 // Change state after process done
 // You can change to default value after get data
 // Make sure the request done and success.
 setTimeout(() => setDoRefetch(false), 50)
}, [])

// Fetch when mount, only first time
useEffect(refetchQuery, [])
```
4. Ready to use in some event, example here:
```tsx
<DeleteButton
  ...
  hideText
  size=""small""
  recordItemId={record.Username}
  onSuccess={refetchQuery}
/>
```
When delete success, call refetchQuery and `useEditableTable` will do re-called (refetch).

Use deep traversal like the one proposed here : https://forum.strapi.io/t/discussion-regarding-the-complex-response-structure-for-rest-graphql-developer-experience/13400/9
```js
const normalize = (data) => {

  const isArray = (data) =>
    Object.prototype.toString.call(data) === '[object Array]'

  const flatten = (data) => {
    if (!data.attributes) return data

    return {

Alternative would be to normalize data after you get query data. This might be too late if you load it as useTable which expect slightly modified data already.

1096650365,1417,[FEAT] Add ability to combine filters into OR arrangement,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Would be awesome if it was possible to include a search all input which could technically be coded as several filters set to the same value. The problem is there is no way to tell the data provider how to combine these values (which ones are AND and which ones are OR). In some providers I've seen these filters just passed on with this being left up to them, for example strapi I think does an AND and if there are 2 filters with the same field it uses OR for those.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if it was possible to include filters in a more complex arrangement that allows for OR constructions being passed to providers while searching, for example:
```typescript
filter = [
    {
      operator: ""eq"",
      field: ""age"",
      value: 20
    },
    {
      operator: ""or"",
      value: [
        {
          field: ""title"",
          operator: ""eq"",
          value: ""Test"",
        },
        {
          field: ""description"",
          operator: ""eq"",
          value: ""Test""
        }
      ]
   }
]
```

Here the query would look like `""age"" == 20 AND (""title"" == ""Test"" OR ""description"" == ""Test"")`

This could be adopted gradually by data providers that support it (for example this would be possible in the Airtable Provider) and ignored by providers that don't.

**Additional context**
In the example on https://refine.dev/docs/guides-and-concepts/search/table-search/ this is solved with the `q` field but this must be available on the database.

As a user It would be nice for filters, sorting and the current page number to stay the same when navigating back to the list of records after updating a record or clicking on the back arrow.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Refine could keep track of the sorting, filters, and page number in the URL (would make it possible to bookmark or share these too) which could then be used for back navigation.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None so far. But I assume this might need some work to save all of this data onto the URL and then update filters, sorting and page numbers accordingly. Especially filters and sorting might need a breaking change - not sure if this change would not go against their current API.

1083645294,1373,[FEAT] Draft: Add support to switch filter operator dynamically from useTable,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently it is only possible to set the filter operator on the initial call to `useTable`. This suggestion would allow switching between full string filter (eq), negation (ne) or partial string match/not match (contains/ncontains).

Operators are set here initially:
https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/445baad768c51fc0c734ddf179402de2664ef471/packages/core/src/hooks/table/useTable/useTable.ts#L144-L146

The filter value can be changed but not the operator:
https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/445baad768c51fc0c734ddf179402de2664ef471/packages/core/src/hooks/table/useTable/useTable.ts#L198-L211

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- Allow <FilterDropdown> changing the operator through props
  - Breaking change?
  - Would antd even allow this for filter?

    ```tsx
    <Table.Column 
        dataIndex=""contentName""
        filterDropdown={({ dropdownProps, filterOperatorProps }) => { // Would something like this even work?
            return (
                <Fragment>
                    <Select onChange={filterOperatorProps.onChange}>
                        <Select.Option value=""eq"">Equals</Select.Option>
                        <Select.Option value=""ne"">Not Equal</Select.Option>
                    </Select>
                    <FilterDropdown {...dropdownProps}><Input /></FilterDropdown>
                </Fragment>
            )
        }}
    />
    ``` 

- Export a helper method from `useTable`, something like `changeFilterOperator(forField: string, newOperator: CrudOperators)` which could be hooked up manually
  - More work for the developer to hook it up but not breaking
  - Supports changing the filter outside the dropdown too which is cool
  - The operator change input field/select would most likely already be inside of the `dropdownFilter` render prop of a column so specifying the column name/field again seems redundant
 
    ```tsx
     const { changeFilterOperator, ...tableProps } = useTable({});

     ...

     useEffect(() => {
         changeFilterOperator(""contentName"", ""contains""); // We can change the filter operator outside of the dropdown
         // Maybe even the value itself with a slightly different signature
         // changeFilter(""contentName"", ""contains"", someWeirdValue);
     }, [someWeirdValue])

    <Table.Column 
        dataIndex=""contentName"" // First column specification
        filterDropdown={(props) => {
            return (
                <Fragment>
                    <Select onChange={(newOp) => changeFilterOperator(""contentName"", newOp)}> // ""contentName"" must be specified here again
                        <Select.Option value=""eq"">Equals</Select.Option>
                        <Select.Option value=""ne"">Equals</Select.Option>
                    </Select>
                    <FilterDropdown {...props}><Input /></FilterDropdown>
                </Fragment>
            )
        }}
    />
    ``` 

> Work in Progress

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Making the initially passed options to `useTable` dynamic so changing them changes the filters state
  - Unintuitive since it behaves differently than react hooks
  - Would overwrite user input or developer would have to merge in current filter input themselves
  - The name of the option is `initialFilters` not `filters` - it's not intuitive that changing these should result in updates ",,
1083384058,1371,[DOC] Specify project node version in Contributions ,"**Is this issue related to an existing part of the documentation? If so, please provide a link**
I think Contributions would be a good place to put this into.

**Describe the thing to improve**
I was not sure which version of node to use for development but I see that package-lock.json is at version 1 so I opted for the latest node 14 version which finally did not seem to adjust package-lock.json on initial install.

My initial install with node 17 upgraded the whole package-lock.json which should not usually not be something a contributor does (I know I hate it when contributors create a PR with 50k lines of changes since they changed the lock version or structure by using a newer node/npm/yarn version). 😅

Either a version file (.nvm, .tool-versions or similar) with the node version or a mention on the [contributing](https://refine.dev/docs/contributing/) page would be good to have.",,
1080104921,1321,[BUG] Caching does not work with useTable due to the returned loading attribute set to true during re-validation,"**Describe the bug**
With the changes introduced in https://github.com/pankod/refine/pull/1319 `useTable` properly returns loading as true while loading is being performed on new requests but now also incorrectly returns true while react query revalidates the response.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to list page
2. Click on a new page through pagination
3. Observe that loader correctly displays
4. Click on previous page
5. Observe that loader appears again even though data is already there (react query merely revalidates the cache at this point)

**Expected behavior**
Loading should not appear when a cached response is ready to be served. This can be achieved by relying either on `status` or on `isSuccess` instead of `isFetching` (which is also true while revalidating cache).

1078765593,1317,[FEAT] filter support for Airtable,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I see that the list query for data providers allows for passing a filter in. It seems the Airtable data provider does not support this yet.

Airtable does support filtering through the [`filterByFormular`](https://vancelucas.com/blog/airtable-api-filterbyformula/) query parameter (supported by the Airtable JS library too).

1078753202,1316,[BUG] useTable returns stale result while loading when using pagination,"**Describe the bug**
`useTable` returns the current data as result (with loading set to false) while loading when using the pagination. Once the result comes in, the hook returns the correct data (loading is still set to false). This causes the loading animation to not play while using pagination since loading is always false.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to list element using useTable
2. Click on another page
3. Observe that stale data is delivered by hook (no loading animation is started)
4. Once data arrives, the page updates with the new data

**Expected behavior**
The hook returns loading true when using pagination instead of a stale result such that the loading animation plays.

I cant set up default operator (for example `conditions`) for filterDropdown
By default it filters by `eq` if it simple value or `in` if array. Operator could be changed by setting up `initialFilter` or `permanentFilter`, in this case filter would be use operator from initial condition. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**

    setFilters((prevFilters) =>

1021373745,1140,[FEAT] Modify strapi-graphql dataProvider to remove reliance on the Strapi REST interface and return both count and totalCount.,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
No

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to see the strapi-graphql dataProvider modified such that it removes reliance upon the Strapi REST endpoint for a collection-type when obtaining count information. In addition, it would be nice to have both the count of results for the current operation, in addition to the total count of entities in the collection.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Making use of another operation to obtain the aggregate count and totalCount from the Connection associated with the collection-type would achieve the above desired results.

we will achieve the requested results: 
- removing the reliance on the REST interface
- reducing two network requests to one
- returning not only the total count of objects, but the count for the current operation as well

960659271,945,undoable mode notification bug,"birinci sorun notification silinmiyordu. 

logic şu şekildeydi;
mutate() sonrası aynı anda şu iki adım çalışıyordu;
- undoableTimeout'dan geriye sayacak bir notification çıkar
- gerçek mutation'ı undoableTimeout kadar sonra setTimeout ile çalıştır.

bu ikisinin aynı anda başlaması, eğer gerçek mutation çok hızlı sonlanırsa (fake rest örneğinde olduğu gibi, ışık hızında çalışıyor), timer sayan notification kapanmaya zaman bulamıyordu. Hemen success notification ile replace ediliyordu.

Aslında burada yaklaşımı değiştirdim,
eğer bir undoable notification'ı cancel edebilme sorumluluğu notification'da ise, süresi geldiğinde çalıştırma sorumluluğunu da notificationItem'a verdim. Bu büyük ölçüde tüm sorumları çözdü.

- [x] Refine her yerde backtick'siz ve küçük yazılsın. @biskuvit 
- [x] Bir yerde interface kullanılmış ise o interface'i gösteren bir alan olsun. https://doc-refine.pankod.com/docs/#showing-and-interacting-with-data bunun gibi olsun @salihozdemir 
- [x] Ant Design yazım şekli her yerde `Ant Design` şeklinde olsun. @umucorn 
- [x] Refer to linklerini ok işaretli olan Refer to linklerine çevirelim. (http://localhost:3002/docs/#showing-the-data bunun gibi) @biskuvit 
- [x] SiderBar'ın güncellenmesi. Dökümanları `Documatation Steps` issue'su içerisine bakarak düzenleyelim. @salihozdemir 
- [x] `Id`tipi `string`olsun. Bazı yerlerde `id: number | string` şeklinde yalnızca `string` olsun. Aynı şekilde `identifier` tiplerine de bakalım. @yildirayunlu 
- [x] Dökümanların içerisinde kullanılan, CrudType, Sort gibi tipleri `Interface References` içerisine koyalım. @umucorn 
- [x] Boş olan linkleri doğru adrese yönlendirmek için içlerini dolduralım. (Siderbar güncellendikten sonra yapılsın) @salihozdemir 


- **Tutorial**
- [x] Setup kısmında superplate ile anlatım olsun. Hem CRA olsun hem superplate. Tab yapısı uygulanabilir. @biskuvit 
- [x] Post'un example response'unu güncelleyelim. @salihozdemir 
- [x] `Note` admonition içerisine data provider için yönlendirme linki koyalım. @umucorn 
- [x] Bootstrap the App başlığı içinde `Tip`'in link'ini Theming With Less documanına yönlendirelim. @biskuvit 
- [x] Gerekli ise `IResourceComponentsProps`'u import edelim. Prop'su öyle kullanalım, gereksiz ise dökümantasyondan kaldıralım. @salihozdemir 
- [x] `You can find detailed usage of useTable from here.` burada ki link kısmına https://doc-refine.pankod.com/docs/useTable link'ini verelim. @biskuvit  
- [x] `info` içerisinde edit button ekleme yerinde `<Table.Column<IPost>` şeklinde olsun, record typle'larını kaldıralım. @umucorn 
- [x] `Save button submits the form and issues a PUT request to the REST API when clicked. After request responses successfully, app will be navigated to listing page on resources/posts with updated data.` Rest API'nin `PUT`'una değilde  dataProvider'ın sağladığı useUpdate fonksiyonunu çalıştırır diyebiliriz. @salihozdemir 
- [x] `Save button submits the form and issues a POST request to the REST API.` Bunun yerine dataProvider daki create fonksiyonu çağırır diyelim. @salihozdemir 
- [x] Adding search and filters başlığı altında `Category`nereden geliyor, eklenmesi gerekiyor. @biskuvit 

- **useCreate**
- [x] Refer to linklerini oklu şekilde yapalım. @umucorn 

- **useManyCreate**
- [x] `CategoryMutationType`'ı doğru mu? Array şeklinde mi dönüyor bakalım. @salihozdemir **Doğruymuş, useCreateMany ile atılan istekler de kaç tane kayıt var ise her bir kayıt için ayrı ayrı istek gönderip response alıyor. Bütün kayıtlar bir array içinde gelmiyor**

-  **useUpdate**
- [x] Refer to `UpdateContext` kısımlarını kullanılan her yerde Internal bir tip olduğunu belirtelim. @biskuvit 

- **useModalForm** @biskuvit, @umucorn 
- [x] İlk cümle daha basit bir hale getirilsin. Çok uzun bir cümle olmuş iki veya üç cümleye bölünebilir. @
- [x] İkinci cümlede [burada]( http://localhost:3002/docs/#fetching-and-managing-data) bulunan useTable kısmın daki gibi basit bir kullanımını gösterebiliriz.
- [x] Üçüncü cümlenin başına `Usage` başlığı oluşturalım.
- [x] `<Create>` ve `<Edit>` içerisinde props'a gerek var mı yok mu bakalım.
- [x] Interface'ler ayrı bir kod parçaçığı içinde gösterilsin.
- [x] Başlık olarak action'ları `create` ve `edit` olarak verelim.
- [x] useStepsForm example başlığı altında açıklamayı burada ekleyelim.

- **useDrawerForm** @umucorn, @biskuvit 
- [x] İlk cümlede Drawer kısmını Ant Desing Drawer'a linkleyelim.
- [x] useModalForm da yapılması gereken şeyleri burada da yapalım. Akışı useModalForm gibi yapalım.

- **useStepsForm** @salihozdemir 
- [x] İlk cümlede ki açıklama useModalForm ve useDrawerForm daki gibi aynı olsun.
- [x] `useStepsFrom` is generic ... yazısının üstüne boşluk koyulabilir.
- [x] `You should use stepsProps on <Steps> component, formProps on the <Form> component correctly. And as the last step, you should render the <Steps> component besides the form like this:` bu cümle yapısı yerine [burada]( http://localhost:3002/docs/#fetching-and-managing-data) bulunan useTable kısmın daki gibi bir kullanımınla anlatabiliriz.
- [x] // make sure to add as much <Step> components
        // as the number of steps in formList array bu iki satır `important` içerisinde olsun.

- [x] Aşağıda ki kodun içerisinde formList direk eklenerek gelsin. Anlatım kodlar eklene eklene devam etsin.
```tsx
<Form {...formProps} layout=""vertical"">
    {formList[current]}
</Form>
```
- [x] Create ve Edit başlıkları oluşturalım. Edit örneğini de yapalım, örneği yaparken Edit'in Create'den farklı olan kısımlarını highlight yapalım.
- [x] API kısmı eklensin. (Bunu bir kişi yapıyor diğerleine aktarıyor.)

bu hook dışarıdan, iki prop almalı.

```
resourceName: string?
id: string?
````

Hook'un default davranışı route'dan okuduğu resourceName ve id'ye göre filtre yapması.

````
    const {
        resource: routeResourceName,
        id: idFromRoute,

eğer kullanıcı prop olarak resourceName ve id yollar ise, react-query'nin route'undan gelen resource ve id'yi **kullanmayacağız**.

```
return {
        queryResult: queryResult as QueryObserverResult<
            GetOneResponse<BaseRecord>

Böylece bir kullanıcı useShow(); dediğinde kullanıcıya ilgili data'yı vermiş olacağız ve kendisi istediği gibi gösterecek.
